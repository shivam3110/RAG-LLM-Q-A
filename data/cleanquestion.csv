Which cloud poses the highest risk to aviation safety during a cold front?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Cumulus fractus.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Cumulonimbus.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Nimbostratus.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Stratus.'}]",Cumulonimbus.,"Refer to figure.
When cold air displaces warm air, it creates a
cold front
. On synoptic charts, cold fronts are represented by blue triangles.
Clouds
: In contrast to warm fronts, cold fronts often bring about a rapid development of clouds, typically occurring 50-100 km ahead of the surface position of the front. These clouds include AC (Altocumulus) and CC (Cirrocumulus) clouds, followed by a sudden appearance of CU (Cumulus) and CB (
Cumulonimbus
) clouds. These cloud formations are often associated with moderate to severe turbulence.
Precipitation
: Showers of rain, which can be heavy at times, are generated by CU and CB clouds along the cold front. Depending on the intensity and season, these showers can manifest as rain, snow, or hail, and there is also the possibility of thunderstorms forming.
Visibility
: Showery precipitation along the cold front typically leads to a reduction in visibility, which can be significant during heavy precipitation and snowfall. However, once the front passes, visibility improves considerably as the falling precipitation helps cleanse the air, removing impurities.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer55261""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=fc4d4e5a-2293-4e6d-9244-e712c191ab82&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/fc4d4e5a-2293-4e6d-9244-e712c191ab82"" alt=""thumb_202306111906_163_503330.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",96266,".

UPDATE:
The Hungarian CAA have approved an appeal based on this question
(which said that two correct answers were present), stating, ""The cold front is the right option, because clearance occurs with a change of air mass, or less commonly with an increase in surface wind.

RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last too long after sunrise, but can stay into the afternoon in certain conditions. Predominantly autumn and winter.
CONDITIONS LEADING TO DISSIPATION OF RADIATION FOG
INSOLATION
- causing convection which will lift the fog. It will also help to evaporate the lower layers.
STRONG WIND – (stronger than 8kt) lifting the fog to form stratus cloud.
CHANGE OF AIR MASS
- This is less common, but of course, if a different air mass moves into an area with radiation fog, the new air mass will have different qualities to the old air mass. For example, in this question, the movement of a cold front would mean that
the new air is not the same air than cooled overnight close to the ground, and so the radiation fog will dissipate
. This is particularly rare though, as a new air mass means that some wind is blowing, which would usually stop radiation fog from forming in the first place.

Which of the following statements concerning an isothermal layer in the atmosphere is correct?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Air parcels that are forced to rise through an isothermal layer keep the same temperature.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'An isothermal layer is absolutely stable.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'An isothermal layer is formed when the air in the layer is well mixed by turbulence.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'The vertical temperature gradient lies between the dry and saturated adiabatic lapse rates.'}]",An isothermal layer is absolutely stable.,"An isothermal layer is defined as a vertical column of air having a constant temperature with height.
Isothermal layers often occur in the low levels of the troposphere during a differential advection situation.
The air within an isothermal layer is stable.To cause air in an isothermal layer to rise it must be forced lifted since it will not rise on its own.
Stability of the atmosphere can be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate):
Absolute stability:
ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR.
Absolute instability:

In a low pressure system the convergence at the surface is caused by:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'frictional forces.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'centrifugal force.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'the curvature of the isobars.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'the inbalance of the horizontal gradient force and the Coriolis force.'}]",frictional forces.,"Refer to figure.
Winds below 2000ft (Friction Layer) are affected by friction –
frictional forces can act to change wind’s direction
and slow it down. Coriolis force will be decreased, the PGF is now more dominant. This causes a change in wind direction – wind blows somewhat across the isobars
towards the low pressure.
As we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic- and blows parallel to isobars.

During Foehn from south the air temperature is generally..,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'the same on both sides of the Alps at the same altitude.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'higher south of the Alps than north of the Alps at the same altitude.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'higher north of the Alps than south of the Alps at the same altitude.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'lower north of the Alps than south of the Alps at the same altitude.'}]",higher north of the Alps than south of the Alps at the same altitude.,"Refer to figure.
FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope
– because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.

If we take a look at the attached figure, we can see that when going from an area of low pressure to an area of high pressure our aircraft will be higher than what it indicates, if we do not change the sub-scale setting on our altimeter.

What is a Polar Depression?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Large depression over the sea with clear weather'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Large depression over the south pole with wintery shower precipitation'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Small depression over the sea with wintery showery precipitation.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Small depression over the north pole with wintery shower precipitation'}]",Small depression over the sea with wintery showery precipitation.,"Refer to figure.
This question refers to a Polar Low:
Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime

What is the direction of the wind of winter monsoon in INDIA?​,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'NE'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'SW'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'SE'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'NW\u200b'}]",NE,"Refer to figures.
MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter
– December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. I
t also affects SE India
, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer41904""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=31B45EE3-DA99-4E76-A55C-D51B7FB0AD59&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/31B45EE3-DA99-4E76-A55C-D51B7FB0AD59"" alt=""thumb_53_773_NE.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer41905""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=E4CDC5D8-DB43-4FE2-9D83-CCC0B237B7B2&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/E4CDC5D8-DB43-4FE2-9D83-CCC0B237B7B2"" alt=""thumb_225_898_SW .png"" /> </a> </div></div>",80291,"s.

TURBULENCE
Within the friction layer, we can identify two types of turbulence:
CONVECTIVE/THERMAL TURBULENCE
Expected on warm summer days when the
sun heats the earth's surface unevenly
. Certain surfaces, such as barren ground, rocky and sandy areas, are heated more rapidly than are grass covered fields and much more rapidly than is water.

Thermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 hrs on clear sunny days (when the highest temperatures are reached)
- In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.
MECHANICAL/FRICTIONAL TURBULENCE

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in
stratiform clouds
. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from
0ºC to -30ºC
, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

What are the typical weather conditions in a cold pool in summer?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Fine weather with thunderstorms in the morning or forenoon'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Ground fog formation is common'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Generally fine weather, thunderstorms in the afternoon or evening'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Precipitation is predominant'}]",Precipitation is predominant,"Refer to figure.
COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer28585""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=3FB25B31-8F17-44E2-B333-BAD9EB026739&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/3FB25B31-8F17-44E2-B333-BAD9EB026739"" alt=""thumb_32_509454.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72426,".

occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C.

- In a matter of seconds, freezing rain can coat an entire airplane, ruin lift, increase weight, block air filters, and render your windshield useless.
The build-up of ice in flight, particularly in cloud and freezing rain, may be very rapid and aircrew should avoid icing conditions:
When ice formation occurs on the leading edges of the aircraft wings and tail plane, the pattern of the airflow becomes modified round the affected part.
This leads to an increase in drag, a decrease in lift, an increase in stalling speed (by as much as 30% in some cases), and perhaps to buffeting

As water condenses, changing from water vapour to the liquid state – it releases energy, in the form of latent heat, to its surroundings. Further heating the surrounding air, leads to more convection and rising of the clouds to higher altitudes. If sufficient moisture is present to condense, the cloud mass could rise through several levels – before it encounters the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere – TROPOPAUSE.
The top of the troposphere, called the tropopause, corresponds to the level in which the pattern of decreasing temperature with height ceases.

As a towering cumulus develops, a large electrical charge separation builds up within the cloud.
Lightning results when this electrical charge becomes strong enough to jump from the cloud to the ground, to another cloud, or to an opposite electrical charge within the same cloud.
In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground.

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature.
Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise.
When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly.
The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows:
The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it.
As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction.
Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.
The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called ""thermals."" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and
higher
up into the atmosphere the
convection
extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.)
In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons.

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature.
Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise.
When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly.
The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows:
The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it.
As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction.
Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.
The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called ""thermals."" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and
higher
up into the atmosphere the
convection
extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.)
In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons.
During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point.
At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time.
The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it."

Note: We have limited feedback about this question, so it may be different in the real exam. The options are also quite debatable, and therefore the current correct answer is not confirmed. Please let us know if you see it in your exam and what you can remember about it, thank you!
Aircraft flying close to a Jet Stream may encounter
Clear Air Turbulence (CAT)
caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear.
CAT occurs around the core of the jet stream, which is in the warm air sector.
The CAT is strongest on the cold/polar/low pressure side of the jet stream core (the North side in the northern hemisphere) next to and just underneath the axis of the Jet Stream
. Approx. at the cold air tropopause level (below the warm air tropopause level).
Another area of strong shear is situated at the border of the upper level front.
These areas are identified by red arrow on the attached figures.
Note: Strong CAT areas are identified on charts by very close spacing of isotachs.
Note:
Core of the jet stream is located in the warm air
– above the level of cold air tropopause and below the warm air tropopause
.
As can be seen in the first annex above, the highest CAT does exist at and above the tropopause near the core, as well as in the region of the front. Therefore, it can be

Aircraft flying close to a Jet Stream may encounter
Clear Air Turbulence (CAT)
caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear.
CAT occurs around the core of the jet stream, which is in the warm air sector.
The CAT is strongest on the cold/polar/low pressure side of the jet stream core (the North side in the northern hemisphere) next to and just underneath the axis of the Jet Stream
. Approx. at the cold air tropopause level (below the warm air tropopause level).
Another area of strong shear is situated at the border of the upper level front.
These areas are identified by red arrow on the attached figures.
Note: Strong CAT areas are identified on charts by very close spacing of isotachs.
Note:
Core of the jet stream is located in the warm air
– above the level of cold air tropopause and below the warm air tropopause
.
As can be seen in the first annex above, the highest CAT does exist at and above the tropopause near the core, as well as in the region of the front. Therefore, it can be
best avoided under the tropopause
(but depending on the scenario, this is quite debatable)."

Ahead of a warm front, freezing rain can be encountered
. Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled.
It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice
.
Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing
, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.

Typical weather in an area under the influence of a High-Pressure is clear skies due to the sinking motion of air (subsidence), lighter winds than around a Depression and reduced chance of precipitation.
A subsidence inversion is sinking air that produces an inversion. When air sinks then it warms adiabatically at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. At some point it gets warmer than the air at a lower level and forms a layer of inversion. This is how subsidence inversion occurs. A situation in which this can occur is within a warm core high pressure system.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31700""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=B8381AC5-0ECF-42BB-A367-A2820ACC81E1&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/B8381AC5-0ECF-42BB-A367-A2820ACC81E1"" alt=""thumb_765_501774.PNG"" /> </a> </div></div>",73320,"

There are two types of satellite - the Polar Orbiting and the Geostationary:
Polar orbits
take the satellites over the Earth’s poles. The satellites travel very close to the Earth (usually between 820 and 970 km above sea level), covering a band 1500 NM wide. Any spot on the globe will experience a southbound pass of the satellite in the morning and a northbound pass in the afternoon or evening.
Although picture definition is good
, polar orbiting satellites do not give a continuous view of the weather.
Geostationary satellites
take 24 hours to orbit the Earth, so the satellite appears to remain in the same part of the sky when viewed from the ground.
These orbits are much higher than polar orbits
(typically 36,000 km) so the satellites travel more slowly, at speeds of around 3 km/s.
Picture definition may not be as good as Polar orbitting satellites images
, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted towards the poles.

GEOSTROPHIC WIND vs GRADIENT WIND
The
Geostrophic wind
blows parallel to straight isobars and is said to have only 2 forces. These 2 forces, Pressure Gradient Force PGF and Coriolis Force CF, must be working opposite from each other and in balance.
The
Gradient wind
occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces:
PGF
CF
Centrifugal Force
(acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation)
GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW
The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing,
gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind.
PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force
GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH
The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing
, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.
How does a Valley Inversion form?
The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.
Consequently,
the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes.
The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.
Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.

The CAT is strongest on the cold/low pressure side of the jet (the north side in the northern hemisphere) next to and just underneath the axis of the Jet Stream.
Strong CAT areas are identified on charts by very close spacing of isotchas.
CAT can also be expected to intensify in areas where the jet stream curves sharply, deep trough exists at the ground surface

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture,
producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon)
.
The SW Monsoon affects all of India

There are five types of anticyclone, warm, cold, temporary cold, ridges (or wedges) and blocking.
Cold and Warm anticyclones are very similar to each other. One starts high pressure and gets higher with altitude (warm high), and the other starts high pressure and gets lower with altitude (cold high).
Cold anticyclones
form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result.
The cold highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW).
Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights; they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards.
Warm anticyclones
(so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.
The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.
Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature.
Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise.
When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly.
The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows:
The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it.
As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction.
Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.
The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called ""thermals."" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the
convection
extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.)
In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons.
During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point.
At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time.

LIGHTNING
As a towering cumulus develops, a large electrical charge separation builds up within the cloud.
Lighting results when this electrical charge becomes strong enough to jump from the cloud to the ground,
to another cloud, or to an opposite electrical charge within the same cloud.
In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.
Types of lightning:
Intra-Cloud lightning

The most common type of lightning.
It happens inside the cloud
, jumping between different charge regions in the cloud. It lights up the cloud to look like the picture above.
Cloud-to-air lightning:
Referring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud.

"The QFF at an airfield located 400 metres above sea level is 1016 hPa. The air temperature is 10°C lower than a standard atmosphere. What is the QNH?

If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero.
QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere.
If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and
if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions
( that is if QNH=QFF).
Because the airport is situated 400 meters above sea level with a QFF of 1016 and the question states the air temperature is 10 degrees lower than ISA, we can calculate the QNH.
400m x 3,285 = 1314 feet
X 1,04 (4 % temperature correction for every 10 degrees below ISA) = 1366,6 feet
/ 27 (drop of 1 hPa according to ISA near the ground) = 50,6 hPa
1314 feet / 27 = 48,7 hPa
50,6 -48,7 = roughly 2 hPa. So, the QNH will be 1014 and the QFF = 1016.
We do not need to do these time-consuming calculations because most of the questions just ask if the QNH would be more or less than QFF.
Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is colder than ISA, the air is more dense and thus pressure will drop faster with altitude.
QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet.
Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted.
The QNH in this case needs to be
lowered
(lower than 1016) because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will overread.
Remember:
ABOVE MSL:
Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH

A possible threat associated with the use of airborne weather radar to detect potentially hazardous conditions is..,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'the omission of and /or difficulties in detecting moderate rain.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'that heavy precipitation forms a shield for the area beyond where severe weather may exist.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'that there is always an error in the determination of wind speed.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'the impossibility to identify the differences between obscuration and precipitation.'}]",that heavy precipitation forms a shield for the area beyond where severe weather may exist.,"Refer to figure.
WEATHER ATTENUATION
The weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a ""shadowing"" effect occurs.
The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,
Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.
Tip for avoiding shadows:
To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.
If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.
If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31479""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=B97881A8-C491-48D1-9502-9A951DBD1945&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/B97881A8-C491-48D1-9502-9A951DBD1945"" alt=""thumb_903_Screenshot 2020-11-04 at 10.45.41.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72862,".

Remember that warm air can take in more water than cold air (due to the air expanding). Cold air can take in less water than warm air (due to air being compressed). So, as air cools, its ability to hold water decreases. Likewise, as air heats up its ability to hold water increases.

A synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area.
Pressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force.
The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means
that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force.
This makes it very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving. There is, however, some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more.
The outflow of air from a high is called divergence
. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days.
The inflow of air into a low is called convergence
.
As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather.

Troposphere
= The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level.
Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.
With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.
Stratosphere
= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.
This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.
The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called
the tropopause
; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.
Mesosphere
= The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.
The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here.
Thermosphere
= The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees.
Exosphere
= The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth.
However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space.

Which condition results in the worst ice build up?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Supercritical planform and freezing fog.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Thick planform and large drops.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Thin planform and large drops.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Thin planform and small drops.'}]",Thin planform and large drops.,"Refer to figure.
Structural Icing: It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
Wings that are
thin
or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of
large water droplets
that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious

Structural Icing: It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
Wings that are
thin
or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of
large water droplets
that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious
of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
⇒ Therefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets."

What winds and air mass characteristics are mainly associated with the winter monsoon in the monsoon regions of the Indian sub-continent?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'South-westerly winds carrying warm and humid air.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'North-westerly winds bringing dry and hazy air.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'North-easterly winds bringing dry and hazy air.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'South-easterly winds carrying warm and humid air.'}]",North-easterly winds bringing dry and hazy air.,"Refer to figures.
MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter
– December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high –
bringing cool and dry continental air
. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31733""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=DAD1DBB6-BF84-4664-BC2B-8E237A4ED2E0&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/DAD1DBB6-BF84-4664-BC2B-8E237A4ED2E0"" alt=""thumb_965_NE.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31734""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=F89DB37D-8F46-4B5F-80E9-0D69AD94ACE8&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/F89DB37D-8F46-4B5F-80E9-0D69AD94ACE8"" alt=""thumb_90_SW .png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72042,"s.

FREEZING RAIN. The conditions needed for freezing rain are quite specific.
Generally, precipitation first falls from a cloud as snow. If it falls through warmer air before reaching the ground, it can melt and turn to rain droplets. If it then falls through cold air again before hitting the ground,
the droplets can become supercooled (which means that they are still falling in liquid state, even though their temperature is below 0ºC).
Freezing rain is a rare type of liquid precipitation that strikes a surface and freezes almost instantly.
Most favourable conditions for the formation of freezing rain:
Temperature inversions

"On a descent to an aerodrome, the crew become distracted and forget to change the altimeter setting back to QNH. The aircraft subsequently lands with standard pressure set on the altimeter.

Assume 27 ft per 1 hPa.","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '856 ft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '2044 ft'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '594 ft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '1450 ft'}]",856 ft,"The aircraft has standard pressure (1013 hPa) set in the altimeter subscale, with 1035 hPa as the actual QNH at the airfield, which would read 1450 ft if set correctly.
The altimeter is not set correctly, and is instead reading out the aircraft's pressure altitude
. That is what the question is asking,
what is the pressure altitude upon landing
?
1450 ft is technically called our ""indicated altitude"" as that is what would show on our altimeter if QNH was set, and the difference between indicated and pressure altitude is the barometric (pressure) correction. The QNH is 1035, which is
22 hPa more than standard
(1013 hPa)
Pressure correction = 22 x 27 = 594 ft
As the pressure is
higher than standard
, the

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:

This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -20ºC

If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero.
QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere.
If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and
if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions
( that is if QNH=QFF).
An altimeter will read an altitude of -69m with the QNH of 1018 hPa set on the altimeter.
Because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude.
QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. QFF is the pressure measured at the airfield adjusted to mean sea level according to the actual temperature conditions.
Because of the decreased density/decrease in pressure drop the QNH has been made a lower number compared to QFF to let the airfield still read the correct elevation with QNH set.
That way we know that the QFF must be higher than 1018 hPa
.
So, with warmer temperatures from an airfield below msl it means that QFF is at a higher pressure than QNH.
QNH set will give you a negative height and as you climb to zero on your altimeter with QNH set, you will be below msl.
Remember:
ABOVE MSL:
Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH
Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH
BELOW MSL:
Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH
Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH
Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",,73041,"QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time.
If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero.
QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere.
If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and
if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions
( that is if QNH=QFF).
An altimeter will read an altitude of -69m with the QNH of 1018 hPa set on the altimeter.

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -8ºC. The airfield elevation must be taken into consideration for the temperature correction: 2 600 ft - 600 ft = 2 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-8) × (2 000/1000) = -64 ft.

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool, often referred to as Cold Air Drop, is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart
and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -
They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer32007""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=63FCFB4B-5EA8-429E-AC63-ABA0D6ED5E35&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/63FCFB4B-5EA8-429E-AC63-ABA0D6ED5E35"" alt=""thumb_892_813_501528.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",66430,".

COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
Conditions associated with a cold front:
Surface winds
:
S
udden change
in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of a cold front.
Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the warmer air mass) are typically out of the southwest, but once the front passes through, winds usually shift around to the northwest (in the colder air mass)
.
Temperature
: steady before the front. A sudden decrease is usually observed at the front. Behind the cold front, it remains steady (cold).
Pressure
:
before the front, it decreases slightly
. At the front it starts to rise (after reaching its lowest value). A slow increase is observed behind the front.
Clouds
: At the cold front, BKN to OVC layers may occur with CU and CB.
However, if the air is stable
cold fronts can also produce nimbostratus clouds (
and
stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.)
Precipitation
: heavy rain or snow showers can be expected. Along with thunderstorms and hail, if the air is unstable.

Learning Objective 050.06.02.08.01: Describe the movements of fronts and pressure systems and the life cycle of a mid-latitude depression.
A mid latitude depression (also called a polar front depression, or a travelling low), is a key part of the global climate and air circulation pattern. It sits on the ""Polar Front"", which is the front between the cold Polar Cell and the warmer Ferrel Cell of the atmosphere, somewhere between 30° and 70° N/S, depending on the season. From here on we will discuss it in relation to the Northern Hemisphere, but just reverse the North and South directions for the Southern Hemisphere Polar Front.
To the North of the Polar Front sits the high pressure zone of the North Pole and the very cold Arctic Circle. To the South of the Polar front sits the subtropical high pressure belt (the Azores high in the Atlantic). This means that the air wants to flow towards the Polar Front from both directions (pressure gradient force), but the air turns right due to the Coriolis effect, so
the wind to the North of the front is East-to-West
and
the air to the South of the front is West-East
. This scenario is
unstable
, and gives rise to
travelling lows
.
Refer to the annex above - it uses different names for the stages.
Initial stage (Frontogenesis)
- The first stage is triggered by a small change in circumstances, the triggers are many, but are not important. The warm air mass begins to push into the cold air mass, creating a kink in the previously non-moving Polar Front.
Mature Stage
- This is where the cold sector begins to ""fight back"", and develops a cold front to claim back some of the land from the warm sector. The depression usually reaches its lowest pressure in this stage, and this stage can last for a good few days. It brings the familiar view of a cold front ""chasing a warm front"".
Occluded Stage
- The cold front has now caught up to the warm front at the centre of the depression, where the weather appears to look like both fronts pass together. Here, the warm sector no longer reaches the ground, and has been lifted into the air in this region. The fronts continue to occlude, and act like a clothing zipper, ""zipping up"" from the base out towards the edge.
Dying Stage
- The fronts are now almost completely occluded, and the depression is beginning to ""fill in"" with pressure. The whole system is beginning to collapse and the warm sector which initially invaded has become isolated from the rest of the warm air to the south, and is forced upwards into the atmosphere where it will disperse. A few things can happen here, including back-bent occlusions, and secondary depressions which may continue to develop.
The dying stage is often accelerated by the depression moving over land, where the air has more friction with the land, and there is no longer a steady source of moisture beneath to feed the system.
Through this whole life cycle, the system is moving towards the East (with some North/South movement according to the Jetstream, Polar Front, etc.), as

"Given:

Outside air temperature at 5 000 ft:

QFE:

What is the true height of the aeroplane above the aerodrome? 
(Barometric lapse rate: 27 ft/hPa)","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '4 190 ft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '4 325 ft'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '4 865 ft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '3 515 ft'}]",3 515 ft,"Refer to figure.
True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 983 hPa = 30 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 30 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­
810 ft
.
This value needs to be
subtracted
from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude
= 5 000 ft - 810 ft =
4 190
ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (5 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (5 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is also +5 ºC, which means OAT = ISA. Therefore,
the temperature correction may be disregarded.
Next, we need to calculate the elevation of the aerodrome: QNH - QFE = 983 hPa - 958 hPa = 25 hPa
The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa:
25 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 675 ft airfield elevation
The true height of the aeroplane below the aerodrome = 4 190 ft – 675 ft =
3 515 ft
below the ground of the aerodrome.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate
(if not provided by the question)
.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×
Indicated alt/1000
=
___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 983 hPa = 30 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 30 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­
810 ft
.
This value needs to be
subtracted
from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude
= 5 000 ft - 810 ft =
4 190
ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (5 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (5 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is also +5 ºC, which means OAT = ISA. Therefore,
the temperature correction may be disregarded.
Next, we need to calculate the elevation of the aerodrome: QNH - QFE = 983 hPa - 958 hPa = 25 hPa
The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa:
25 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 675 ft airfield elevation
The true height of the aeroplane below the aerodrome = 4 190 ft – 675 ft =
3 515 ft
below the ground of the aerodrome.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate
(if not provided by the question)
.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×
Indicated alt/1000
=
___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This question is quite difficult to answer, as
jet streams do cause very intense clear air turbulence due to vertical and horizontal windshear
. Mountainous areas can produce mountain waves, especially when a stable atmosphere exists (so the air flows down again after being forced upwards), and mountain waves can travel way up into the atmosphere when there is a gradually strengthening wind, which would likely be the case if a jet stream is present at high altitudes.
The aircraft is a jet aircraft in the cruise, so we can assume it is at high altitude, around the region of 30 000 - 45 000 ft, just inside or above the jetstream. To give an answer to this question, we
can be almost certain that there will be clear air turbulence occuring due to the jetstream

Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory.

A nocturnal low-level jet
is a fast-moving air current in the lower atmosphere
during night time when the skies are clear
. As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night.
A Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion.
The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet:
There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop
. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion.
The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase.
If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet
The other options here are either incorrect or made up by the examiner.
The polar night jet is another term for the arctic jetstream as far as we can tell. It happens around 20 000 ft around the poles during their winter, when they get extremely cold due to the polar night.
A low-level sting jet is a mostly made up term.
Sting jets are a thing to do with weather forecasting and can form very powerful storms but these jets are at high level, not formed in this way, and are way off the ATPL syllabus.

is a fast-moving air current in the lower atmosphere
during night time when the skies are clear
. As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night.
A Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion.
The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet:
There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop
. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion.
The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase.
If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet
The other options here are either incorrect or made up by the examiner.
The polar night jet is another term for the arctic jetstream as far as we can tell. It happens around 20 000 ft around the poles during their winter, when they get extremely cold due to the polar night.
A low-level sting jet is a mostly made up term.
Sting jets are a thing to do with weather forecasting and can form very powerful storms but these jets are at high level, not formed in this way, and are way off the ATPL syllabus.
A squall line jet is not a thing. Squall lines are line of thunderstorms, so certainly not the case in this scenario."

The geostrophic wind blows parallel to straight and equidistant isobars.
Wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force PGF (from high to low). As the movement begins, the Coriolis force CF begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other.

There are two types of satellites; Polar Orbiting and Geostationary.
Polar Orbiting satellite
passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited. It takes roughly 2 h to orbit the earth. This satellite orbits between 820 and 870 km above the surface and covers a band 1500 NM wide. Picture definition is good due to its relatively low orbit height –

After reading this question, the first thing that pops in my mind is a
Valley Inversion
-
due to the location of the airfield (basin within mountainous area) and the presence of a High Pressure system.
To simplify this question, let's break it down in two parts:
""in the early morning"" and ""engines of the aircraft will deliver more thrust after breaking through the inversion layer if the pilot does not intervene.
"" explained:
A Valley Inversion forms as a result of both cooling of the ground during a clear night (
typical High Pressure weather conditions.)
due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds.
The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.
Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.
Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is formed.
=>
Since inversions occur most often during the night, its effects will be more marked in the early morning.
Moreover, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we descend through an inversion,
temperature decreases with a decrease in height => we will experience an increased aircraft performance
, l
eading to an increase in thrust
and lift, as we dense into colder and denser air.
""after a short period of bumpiness"" explained:
Temperature Inversions are associated with potential windshear at the top of the inversion.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion
and turbulence.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31930""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=C0EA0B8E-B999-4080-A865-F1FA74552CF0&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/C0EA0B8E-B999-4080-A865-F1FA74552CF0"" alt=""thumb_623_274_Low_Level_Inversion.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31931""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=AC73EC36-E253-4481-8399-8B6CA7A0070A&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/AC73EC36-E253-4481-8399-8B6CA7A0070A"" alt=""thumb_478_282_503290.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72433,".

The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.
Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is formed.
=>
Since inversions occur most often during the night, its effects will be more marked in the early morning.
Moreover, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we descend through an inversion,
temperature decreases with a decrease in height => we will experience an increased aircraft performance
, l
eading to an increase in thrust
and lift, as we dense into colder and denser air.
""after a short period of bumpiness"" explained:
Temperature Inversions are associated with potential windshear at the top of the inversion.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion
and turbulence."

The correct option describes the ideal conditions for Freezing Rain.
Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C.
Now, f
reezing Rain can cause significant accumulations
of clear ice.
Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing
. The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Clear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice.
""Level flight in

HUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.
Humidity Measurement
Absolute Humidity
Refers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3
Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)
Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.
Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)
The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.
Expressed as g/kg of dry air.
Relative Humidity (RH)
The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.
Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.
RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100
RH 100% = Saturation
Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.
From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.
Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.

is not affected by a change in air temperature

An aircraft is cleared to fly at FL 050. The QNH is 1 030 hPa and this remains set on the altimeter due to the flight crew forgetting the pressure setting change. The aircraft is...,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '510 ft higher than the cleared altitude.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '800 ft higher than the cleared altitude.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '460 ft lower than the cleared altitude.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '510 ft lower than the cleared altitude.'}]",510 ft lower than the cleared altitude.,"During climb, pilots change the altimeter to standard pressure (1013 hPa) when passing through the transition altitude. Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.
It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL 050 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1030 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 5 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the surrounding traffic. In this case, the aircraft is referring to their indicated altitude rather than the pressure altitude they should be using.
Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure:
1030 – 1013 = 17 hPa
Using the assumed barometric lapse rate of
30 ft/hPa
:
17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft
The aircraft is 510 ft above or below the required flight level. to find this out, we can use the rules that state:
When QNH is
higher
than standard --> Indicated altitude is
higher
than pressure altitude.
When QNH is

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.
It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL 050 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1030 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 5 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the surrounding traffic. In this case, the aircraft is referring to their indicated altitude rather than the pressure altitude they should be using.
Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure:
1030 – 1013 = 17 hPa
Using the assumed barometric lapse rate of
30 ft/hPa
:
17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft
The aircraft is 510 ft above or below the required flight level. to find this out, we can use the rules that state:
When QNH is
higher
than standard --> Indicated altitude is
higher
than pressure altitude.
When QNH is
lower
than standard --> Indicated altitude is
lower
than pressure altitude.
The aircraft's indicated altitude is therefore higher than pressure altitude,

higher
than pressure altitude. We are therefore expecting the altimeter reading to decrease during this subscale setting procedure. We can calculate this decrease using a barometric correction.

The geostrophic force is strongest:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'At the equator'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'At mid latitudes'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Close to the equator'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Close to the poles'}]",Close to the poles,"Note: Remember that Geostrophic force is not Geostrophic Wind. GF is, in other words, Coriolis Force.
GEOSTROPHIC FORCE
The geostrophic wind flows parallel to straight isobars, limiting its movement to a straight trajectory. The geostrophic wind is under the influence of two primary forces: the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and the Coriolis Force (CF).
The PGF prompts air movement from regions of high pressure towards those of low pressure, acting at a right angle (90°) to the isobars. In the absence of the Coriolis Force, air would move directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, perpendicular to the isobars. However, the Coriolis Force (CF) plays a role in the air's motion, which changes with latitude and wind speed. (
At the Equator, CF is negligible and it strengthens as one moves towards the poles; it also intensifies with increasing wind speed
.) As the air begins moving, the CF, acting at a 90° angle to the airflow, deflects it (to the right in the Northern hemisphere). When the CF combines with the PGF, the airflow's velocity increases due to this additional force. Consequently, the CF's influence grows, leading to further deflection and increased speed, creating a feedback loop. Eventually, the CF strengthens to the point of equilibrium with the PGF, causing the airflow to become parallel to the isobars.
The Geostrophic Force increases with the speed of the air, and it is dependent on the sine of the latitude,
being maximum at the Poles
(sin 90° = 1) and zero at the Equator.",,66393,"Note: Remember that Geostrophic force is not Geostrophic Wind. GF is, in other words, Coriolis Force.

What can contribute to the dissipation of orographic fog?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'An increase in dew point value.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'An anabatic wind.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'A katabatic wind.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'An increase in ground humidity.'}]",A katabatic wind.,"Refer to figure.
HILL/OROGRAPHIC FOG. Usually stratiform cloud (ST, SC) whose base is lower than the summit of the hills.
Formed when humid stable air is forced to ascend along the side of a mountain or hill
or by the normal turbulence action producing ST and SC.
Formed during the day or night.
As the air rises, it cools adiabatically => condensation level is reached, and a cloud is formed.
Hill fog requires a wind up the slopes of a mountain (anabatic wind) and is promoted by high humidity. The hill fog quickly disappears if the wind changes (e.g.

HILL/OROGRAPHIC FOG. Usually stratiform cloud (ST, SC) whose base is lower than the summit of the hills.
Formed when humid stable air is forced to ascend along the side of a mountain or hill
or by the normal turbulence action producing ST and SC.
Formed during the day or night.
As the air rises, it cools adiabatically => condensation level is reached, and a cloud is formed.
Hill fog requires a wind up the slopes of a mountain (anabatic wind) and is promoted by high humidity. The hill fog quickly disappears if the wind changes (e.g.
katabatic flow

The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude.
Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights
=> in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards.
Warm anticyclones
(so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.
The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.
Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>

The transition from SW to NE monsoon in India occurs in:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'February - April.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'December - February.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'September - November.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'July - September.'}]",September - November.,"Refer to figures.
MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter – December, January and February
, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.
As we have seen above, the SW Monsoon occurs between June and August and the NE Monsoon occurs between December and February => the transition between these two occurs between September and November.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31731""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=D770D07D-D119-45A9-85FC-1157C6E19D63&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/D770D07D-D119-45A9-85FC-1157C6E19D63"" alt=""thumb_198_NE.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31732""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=973CB37A-F0AB-4FFD-AC70-C16019B08E8E&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/973CB37A-F0AB-4FFD-AC70-C16019B08E8E"" alt=""thumb_308_SW .png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73055,"s.

Ice crystals phenomenon has only recently been identified as a serious threat to turbine engines. Ice crystals previously were thought to be harmless to airplanes because they will not adhere to the external airframe, and will simply bounce off the airframe without accreting.
Nowadays, researchers believe that ice crystals can partially melt, due to compression effects, as they pass through the engine fan section, enter the engine core and create a film of moisture on relatively warm surfaces, such as the forward stator vanes.
The moisture traps additional ice crystals, and, eventually, the ice buildup is shed into the compressor, causing the engine to surge and stall and possibly the combustor, causing a flameout.

What’s the direction of the wind of summer monsoon in INDIA?​,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '\u200bNE'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'SW'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'SE'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'NW'}]",SW,"Refer to figures.
MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of
India
, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud.

Note: We think this question is very tough, and whilst it is answerable with the knowledge required for the ATPLs, it requires different sections of knwoledge, and for them to be put together in the correct way. It is also very much an ATPL question only, as it refers specifically to what we are supposed to know about meteorology, and does not include any further knowledge. Please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and what you remember from it, so we can verify the question and options, thank you!
There are a few different bits of knowledge that you need here. Firstly, you must understand the global circulation pattern of air around the Earth. Things such as; where is a consistent high pressure surface zone, the ITCZ, ascending and subsiding air zones, and particularly
travelling lows
. Then you must understand how the jet streams are formed based on that global circulation. Finally, you must understand
how jet streams are affected by (and affect) the surface weather conditions
, and then you have to link all that information together.
When you do, you find that
the correct answer is the
polar jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere.
Some people will be happy to leave it at that, and know the answer, but for those of you who want to know why, see the explanation below. It will have to skip over lots of details, as there are a lot of topics to link together here and this explanation could get huge if everything were to be explained in full.
Assuming you know about the global circulation pattern of air, you will know that the polar front (between the Ferrel cell and polar cell of the atmosphere) creates ""
travelling lows
"", also known as
polar front depressions
. For the purposes of the exams, these form somewhat consistently over the oceans; for us in Europe, we see the ones flowing from the Atlantic.
There are a few different jet streams that form over the Earth. There are the subtropical jet stream over the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, which is quite consistent, as well as the
polar jet stream
, also in both hemispheres and relatively consistent through the seasons. There is an arctic jet stream that forms over the pole which is in its winter (polar night - extremely cold). There is also a jet stream which flows the opposite way to the others (it is Easterly rather than the usual Westerlies) which is the equatorial jet stream, forming around June-August.
The jet streams have a large effect on the surface weather
, particularly that beneath them, and
this relationship goes both ways
, with the
surface pressure patterns and surface temperature very much affecting the jet stream's flow, speed and direction
.
In particular, the jet stream we must know most about is the
polar jet stream
, and this is the one that sits above (not directly above - but close to) the
surface level travelling lows on the polar front
.
Each travelling low causes
the polar jet stream to bend
, as the polar front is bent as part of the frontogenesis cycle
.
This is what the question is asking
.
The other jet streams are not bent as strongly or as often as the polar jet stream, due to their different circulation patterns
.
Thankfully, it is not asked in this question, but between the Northern Hemisphere polar jet stream and the Southern Hemisphere polar jet stream, we would say that they both bend significantly, but the much greater amount of landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere create a more ""unstable"" jet stream, in that has much less regular movements, whereas the Southern Hemisphere has a lot less land to interfere with the jet stream.

CIRROSTRATUS (CS) – is a transparent, whitish cloud-veil of fibrous or smooth appearance, totally or partially covering the sky. Sometimes may produce white or coloured rings, spots or arcs of light around the Sun or Moon, that are known as halo phenomena. Sometimes they are so thin that the halo is the only indication that a cirrostratus cloud is in the sky.

Insolation and clouds
The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere,
reflected off clouds back into space
, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or
absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed).
This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength)
infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection.
The clouds then have an effect on the outgoing infrared radiation, by
absorbing this radiation, and re-radiating it back down

a blanket

Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (

). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. R
esearch has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.

SATELLITE IMAGERY
Cloud detection.
There are two methods of producing the weather picture; visual photography and infrared.
Visual Images.
Although visual photography may be easy to interpret, it suﬀers the disadvantage of not being available continuously, due to lack of sunlight at night. Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black
- Visible satellite image show solid clouds (such as CBs) as bright white and wispy clouds (thin or faint cloud - such as cirrus) as translucent whitish layers.
Infrared (IR).
Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image =>
If the clouds near the surface are approx. same temperature as the land surface it can be difficult to distinguish the clouds from land.
To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images.
If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area.
If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud

There are five types of anticyclone, warm, cold, temporary cold, ridges (or wedges) and blocking.
We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones:
Cold anticyclones
form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result.
The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude.
Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards.
Warm anticyclones
(so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.
The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.

There are five types of anticyclone, warm, cold, temporary cold, ridges (or wedges) and blocking.
We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones:
Cold anticyclones
form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result.
The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude.
Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards.
Warm anticyclones
(so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.
The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.
Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>
Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels.
Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures."

FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (upwind side of the mountain, in this case, the south), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates.
After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes
. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.

Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as ""sublimation"" in meteorology).
In many incidents, a recurring pattern involves the initial
accumulation and formation of ice crystals on relatively warmer surfaces near the front of an engine
. Subsequently, these crystals detach and
partially melt as they pass through the engine core
. This process can lead to uncommanded thrust reduction and potentially
cause engine damage
. An indication that a significant encounter with ice crystal icing (ICI) is occurring is typically observed through a gradual decrease in engine rpm and a simultaneous increase in Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT).

"If we assume clear skies and minimal to no wind, what kind of surface conditions are most conducive to the development of a radiation inversion?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Grass'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Sea'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Desert'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Forest'}]",Desert,"Refer to figure.
A
radiation inversion
occurs on
cold winter nights characterized by clear skies and minimal to no wind
. In such conditions, the dry air above the surface allows long-wave radiation to escape from the atmosphere during the night, a phenomenon known as nocturnal radiation. As a result, both the surface and the adjacent air cool down. This atmospheric setup can result in the development of ground-level fog. However, the presence of clouds can impede or entirely halt this cooling process.
Desert air
, characterized by its extreme dryness, is prone to the formation of radiation inversions on almost any summer night. In the daytime, the sun intensely warms the ground and the adjacent atmosphere. However, as evening descends and the sun disappears below the horizon, the primary heat source vanishes. In response, the
desert's sand rapidly releases its stored heat and undergoes a rapid cooling process
. This immediate cooling effect extends to the air just above the surface, resulting in air temperatures near the ground dropping by as much as 15ºC within a matter of hours.
This phenomenon of cold surfaces and warmer upper air layers constitutes what is known as a temperature inversion
. It's important to note that water, with its superior heat-retaining properties compared to rock and sand, is notably absent in the desert environment.

A synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area.
Pressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force.
The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means
that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force.
This makes it
very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving

TROPICAL REVOLVING STORMS (TRS). Are thermal depressions that develop over warm tropical oceans (wind speeds in excess of 33 kts). When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones.

COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.
A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.
Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns.
- Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation.
- An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31694""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=68EB5B06-CD79-4F1F-8E83-BC5FBB9B2F34&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/68EB5B06-CD79-4F1F-8E83-BC5FBB9B2F34"" alt=""thumb_277_502055.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31695""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=A5761F1B-62D6-4618-BC25-F28C68A4F02A&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/A5761F1B-62D6-4618-BC25-F28C68A4F02A"" alt=""thumb_324_502133(2).png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72968,"s.

RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly autumn and winter.
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM
Little clouds or clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground.
High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and
condensation.
Calm or very light wind – which will result in rapid cooling. 2 - 8 kt to mix the layers of air causing turbulence => promotes a thicker layer.

Refer to figure.
For our syllabus, India has two primary seasons with transitional times between the two, explained by the SW and NE monsoons.
A monsoon is a seasonal wind, and India experiences 2 monsoons during the year, The one in this question is the SW monsoon that blows during the summer (
June - September
), when the ITCZ is quite far Northwards, into and North of India and up to as far as the Siberian Peninsula. The ITCZ is an area of low pressure due to the intense heating, and therefore
the surface wind flows towards it
. This pulls warm water out of the Indian Ocean, turning into humid, unstable air masses over the hot Indian land mass, and can form into some
very large and violent thunderstorms across India
. These bring
huge amounts of rainfall
, and hence,
the SW monsoon season is very much classed as the rainy season.
The NE monsoon occurs at the opposite time of year, from October to December, when the ITCZ has gone to the South, now firmly within the Indian Ocean. This low pressure surface zone attracts the wind from all directions, meaning that much cooler, drier air flows over India from the North and North-East, then out towards the Indian Ocean.
If you can picture the movement of the ITCZ throughout the year and know that air flowing from ocean to land brings rain, these questions become simple, and the Indian monsoon seasons are easy to work out every time.

True Altitude is the real distance beneath the aircraft to the ground. Indicated altitude is only the same as true altitude if the temperature and pressure conditions are equal to the ISA conditions.

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. Below, we will describe NE and SW Monsoon.
NE MONSOON
:
In winter – December, January and February
, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over
central India
, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The
SW Monsoon affects all of India

"If atmospheric conditions exist such that the temperature deviation is ISA +10°C in the lower troposphere up to 18 000 ft, what is the actual layer thickness between FL60 and FL120?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '5 760 ft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '6 000 ft'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '6 240 ft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '5 900 ft'}]",6 240 ft,"Refer to figure.
If the real temperature conditions were equal to ISA conditions, the thickness would be 6 000 ft
(FL120 - FL60
),
however this is not the case.
The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows: Correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (6 000/1 000) =
240 ft
.
You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL120 and FL60 individually or to the layer thickness (FL120 - FL60). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.
In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 240 ft, giving us a layer thickness of
6 240
ft.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

"In what area has a pilot to be cautious and mindful of severe clear air turbulence, when planning a route?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'In a subsidence inversion layer.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'In icing areas near warm fronts.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Above the tropopause.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'In the vicinity of a jet stream.'}]",In the vicinity of a jet stream.,"Refer to figure.
CLEAR AIR TURBULENCE
It is commonly thought of as a high-altitude phenomenon. It is normally encountered above 15000ft. However, it can take place at any altitude and is often present with no visual warning.
CAT can be caused by the interaction of layers of air with differing wind speeds, convective currents, or obstructions to normal wind flow.
It often develops in or near the jet stream
(narrow band of high-altitude winds near the tropopause).
Clear air turbulence tends to occur in thin layers, typically less than 2000ft deep, less than 20 NM wide and more than 50 NM long.
CAT can form when a layer of air slides over the top of another, relatively slower moving layer. Eventually the difference in speed might cause waves and, in some cases, distinctive clouds to form.
Jet streams can sometimes be identified by long streams of cirrus cloud formations. The turbulence associated with a jet stream can be very strong, and because it often occurs in clear air, it is difficult to forecast accurately.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31266""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=E73F84F8-8688-49B1-A8EE-066FAC74A70B&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/E73F84F8-8688-49B1-A8EE-066FAC74A70B"" alt=""thumb_776_507394.jpg"" /> </a> </div></div>",72573,".

FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes
of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
=>
One such wind is the Chinook which blows on the eastern side of the Rocky mountains in Canada - usually blows during the winter months and produces a rapid and considerable rise in temperature.
How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31717""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=12DC3711-C910-4A12-8C99-7CB0A82827F4&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/12DC3711-C910-4A12-8C99-7CB0A82827F4"" alt=""thumb_762_Foehn_EFFECT.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73365,".

The
Gradient wind

PGF
CF
Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation)
GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH
The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing
, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.
CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force
GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW
The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

"Check the correctness of the following statements.

2. For unsaturated air the dew-point temperature is lower than the temperature","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '1 and 2 are correct'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '1 is correct, 2 is not correct'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '1 and 2 are not correct'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '1 is not correct, 2 is correct'}]","1 is not correct, 2 is correct","“The maximum water vapour pressure is higher over ice than over water with the same temperature”
INCORRECT
The vapor pressure - is the pressure exerted by the water vapor molecules in the air. As the number of water vapour molecules increases, the vapour pressure increases.
If heat is added and temperature increased, the molecules will have more internal energy and will start to move faster. Eventually, they will be able to break free and evaporate from the surface and the vapor pressure will increase => the saturation vapor pressure increases when the temperature increases.
For a liquid surface it will be much easier for water molecules to break free and evaporate than for a solid surface (ie. Ice). That is because the bonds between adjacent molecules are stronger in an ice surface than they are in a water surface. At the same temperature, fewer molecules will break free from an ice surface than from a water surface,
=> Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure over liquid water.
“For unsaturated air the dew-point temperature is lower than the temperature”
CORRECT
Dew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for
saturation to occur.
When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated.
Dew point temperature is NEVER GREATER than the air temperature.
Therefore, if the air cools, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation.

945 ft
Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction
TA = 6500 ft - 945 ft = 5555 ft
The elevation at B is 930 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 5555 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 5555 ft - 930 ft =
4625 ft
Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude.
If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.
Alternatively, you can think of it this way:
- You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 977 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 930 ft AMSL.
- Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1012 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 930 ft + 945 ft = 1875 ft => however, we are still on the ground.
- We will now climb to 6500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1012). We need to climb 6500 ft - 1875 ft = 4625 ft (which is our height over the surface).
Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",,73122,"The aircraft departs from A with its altimeter set on local QNH of 1012 hPa. The flight is performed maintaining a constant
Indicated Altitude of 6 500 ft based on Point A's QNH of 1012 hPa

In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way:
If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 977 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure:

Please send us any further exam feedback you have, thank you!
The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a broad zone of air mass sometimes called the heat equator.
Here, the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide. Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere.
As the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth’s midsection. these convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear.
The ITCZ is a low pressure zone
,
due to the intense heating of the local air from the hot ground/sea
, leading to large updrafts of air, which can form very violent thunderstorms, climbing to altitudes of 55-60 000 ft at their highest.
Therefore, it can be very dangerous to fly in the region of the ITCZ. Mostly, this is due to rapidly changing, unpredictable, violent weather conditions. For this question though, that is not part of any of the options. Instead, this question is asking about the dangers of the

Icing in a venturi carburetor is most likely to occur at temperatures:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Below 5⁰C.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Between -45⁰C and -10⁰C.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Between -10⁰C and +30⁰C.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Above 0⁰C.'}]",Between -10⁰C and +30⁰C.,"Refer to figure.
Induction icing affects engine power and includes when ice forms in the carburettor venturi. It can occur when the
outside air temperature is between -10ºC and +30ºC
and with a high relative humidity.
Carburettor icing is particularly common, as the air cools down significantly inside the carburettor, not only due to the decreased static pressure in the venturi section (decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the evaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air. It is worse when the throttle is low, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect.

SUBSIDENCE is related to a HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM/ANTICYCLONE.
Within an anticyclone,
at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface.
Typical weather in an area under the influence of a High-Pressure is clear skies due to the sinking motion of air (subsidence), lighter winds than around a Depression and reduced chance of precipitation.
Weather associated with High Pressure Systems:
Summer (and cold high pressure systems in winter):
- CLOUD: none except on the edge of the anticyclone
- PRECIPITATION: none
- VISIBILITY: Generally moderate with haze
- TEMPERATURE: Dependent on type

SUBSIDENCE is related to a HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM/ANTICYCLONE.
Within an anticyclone,
at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface.
Typical weather in an area under the influence of a High-Pressure is clear skies due to the sinking motion of air (subsidence), lighter winds than around a Depression and reduced chance of precipitation.
Weather associated with High Pressure Systems:
Summer (and cold high pressure systems in winter):
- CLOUD: none except on the edge of the anticyclone
- PRECIPITATION: none
- VISIBILITY: Generally moderate with haze
- TEMPERATURE: Dependent on type
- WINDS: Light

WARM FRONT. Can be defined as warm air replacing cold air.

Subsidence inversions occur when high surface pressure is present. This brings divergence at the surface, causing the air column above the high pressure to subside. This air warms up at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) of 3ºC/1000ft, which means that the air quickly gets quite warm, often quite a bit warmer than the air near the ground. This temperature difference will eventually stop the air descending any further, and instead the air begins to spread outward in divergence, but
with a layer of cooler air trapped underneath this inversion that has formed
. The inversion usually exists at around 2 - 3 000 ft, and can bring a reduction in visibility due to haze and other particles in the air under the inversion.

HOAR FROST
It occurs when a sub-zero surface comes into contact with moist air (the ambient temperature is lowered to saturation level). It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air.
Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating).
This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles).
Hoar frost can occur:
on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.

HUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.
Humidity Measurement
Absolute Humidity
Refers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3
Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)
Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.
Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)
The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.
Expressed as g/kg of dry air.
Relative Humidity (RH)
The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.
Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.
RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100
RH 100% = Saturation
Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.
From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.
Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too.
As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases.
On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31848""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=7788F1D4-2C66-4784-98AE-439E1DD46D57&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/7788F1D4-2C66-4784-98AE-439E1DD46D57"" alt=""thumb_94_Relative humidity.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",71980,".

Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in
high altitude
due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (
often referred to as ""sublimation"" in meteorology
).
Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected
.
Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions
. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.
The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer37498""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=7E7AAEAD-B47C-478D-9731-5B431CCA2A06&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/7E7AAEAD-B47C-478D-9731-5B431CCA2A06"" alt=""thumb_657_51_636_509271.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",77705,".

“The Earth is heated by long-wave radiation from the Sun, but cooled by its own short-wave radiation into space.”
Incorrect
.
Heat is transferred via radiation from the Sun to the Earth’s surface. Primarily, insolation can be considered the process via which the atmosphere is heated. The wavelength of radiated energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of whatever is emitting it. As the Sun is very hot, its radiations are of shorter wavelength than those from the Earth.
“The Earth only radiates heat into space between sunset and sunrise.”
Incorrect
The Earth receives a large amount of energy from the Sun. and it is this energy that results in a warm, livable planet. However, only a certain amount of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and used to heat the Earth. About 70% is absorbed by the planet, and the remaining 30% is reflected back to space by various surfaces such as clouds, ice, and deserts. The Earth is constantly absorbing and radiating energy.
“Cloud cover has NO effect on the amount of the Sun's radiated heat arriving at the Earth's surface.”
Incorrect
.
Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth.
Correct
.
“More heat is radiated into space from a warm surface than from a cold surface.”

“The Earth is heated by long-wave radiation from the Sun, but cooled by its own short-wave radiation into space.”
Incorrect
.
Heat is transferred via radiation from the Sun to the Earth’s surface. Primarily, insolation can be considered the process via which the atmosphere is heated. The wavelength of radiated energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of whatever is emitting it. As the Sun is very hot, its radiations are of shorter wavelength than those from the Earth.
“The Earth only radiates heat into space between sunset and sunrise.”
Incorrect
The Earth receives a large amount of energy from the Sun. and it is this energy that results in a warm, livable planet. However, only a certain amount of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and used to heat the Earth. About 70% is absorbed by the planet, and the remaining 30% is reflected back to space by various surfaces such as clouds, ice, and deserts. The Earth is constantly absorbing and radiating energy.
“Cloud cover has NO effect on the amount of the Sun's radiated heat arriving at the Earth's surface.”
Incorrect
.
Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth.
Correct
.
“More heat is radiated into space from a warm surface than from a cold surface.”
The temperature of an object dictates how quickly they will lose energy to their surroundings. Hotter objects emit more radiation than colder objects, and thus a hotter planet will shed more energy to space than a colder planet."

WINDSHEAR
Windshear is a sudden, drastic shift in wind speed and/or direction that occurs over a short distance at any altitude in a vertical or horizontal plane. It can subject your airplane to sudden updrafts, downdrafts or extreme horizontal wind components, causing loss of lift or violent changes in vertical speeds or altitudes.
We emphasise the significance of low level wind shear, which is hazardous for aircraft during take-off and landing. Sudden changes in the direction and speed of the air flow may cause a loss of altitude, and being too close to ground, the altitude will not be enough for correction.

at a specific temperature and pressure. The process that leads to saturation is influenced by various factors, but in this context, we'll focus on the options provided.
a) ""Increasing the air pressure"":
INCORRECT
. While increasing air pressure can impact the air's capacity to hold water vapour, it does not directly lead to saturation. Higher pressure allows the air to hold more water vapour.
b) ""Increasing the amount of water vapor in the air"": This is the
CORRECT
answer. When more water vapour is introduced into the air, it increases the humidity level. As the air accumulates water vapour, it approaches its saturation point. Once the air reaches this saturation point, further additions of water vapour will lead to condensation, forming clouds or precipitation.
c) ""Increasing the temperature of the air"":
INCORRECT
. Raising the air temperature does not directly cause the air to become saturated. However, it is an essential factor in determining the air's capacity to hold water vapour. Warm air can accommodate more water vapour than cold air. As the temperature increases, the air can hold more moisture, thus reducing relative humidity - making saturation less likely.
d) ""Decreasing the amount of water vapour in the air"":
INCORRECT
. Lowering the amount of water vapour in the air reduces the humidity level, making saturation less likely. The air becomes drier, it does not cause the air to become saturated.
AIR BECOMES SATURATED:

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes.

How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.

Which of the following temperature ranges would be most conducive to forming carburettor ice?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Below -20°C'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Between 0°C and -15°C'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Between 0°C and 15°C'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Between 0°C and 20°C'}]",Between 0°C and 15°C,"Refer to figures.
Aircraft icing can be divided into two general types based on whether it affects power production or aerodynamics. Induction icing affects engine power and includes when ice forms in the carburettor venturi. It can occur when the
outside air temperature is between -10ºC and +30ºC and with a high relative humidity.
Carburettor icing is particularly common, as the
air cools down significantly inside the carburettor
, not only due to the
decreased static pressure in the venturi section
(decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the
evaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor
, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air.
It is worse when the throttle is low
, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect.
As you can see by the graph above, the
worst icing happens between about -1ºC and +15°C,
which is very close to the correct answer given here.
Too warm, and the air won't cool down enough in the carburettor to form ice.

"In a mountainous area, a minimum safe altitude of 8000 ft is given. An airport in the vicinity with an elevation of 0 ft reports the following data: an air temperature of -24°C at FL100, a pressure value QNH of 990 hPa. Which is the lowest usable flight level under these conditions?  Assume 1 hPa = 27 ft.","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'FL120.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'FL90.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'FL100.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'FL70.'}]",FL100.,"Refer to figure.
Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
8 000 ft
.
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­-5 ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-24ºC, which is an ISA deviation of
ISA -19ºC
.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -19ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-19) × (8 000/1000) =
-608 ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added
to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­8 608
ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa =
23 hPa
. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =
621 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 8 608 ft + 621 ft =
9 229 ft
.
As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 9 229 ft, which is
FL100
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×

___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Airframe icing is a huge hazard to flight. In icing conditions, pilots have to be very careful. Not only does ice accretion
add weight and drag
to an aircraft, it also
changes the shape of the wing, reducing the finely tuned lift characteristics.
It can also block probes and ice over ports or vanes. Airframe icing happens primarily whilst flying in an area with an
air temperature just below 0ºC
, and therefore with an airframe below freezing temperature. Clouds can often contain droplets of water that are below freezing temperature (0ºC), but are still in liquid form.
These are called Super-Cooled Water Droplets (SCWDs)
. As soon as SCWDs hit a freezing airframe, they will freeze onto it.
This freezing can take place a bit differently depending on the droplet size and temperature. If the droplets are large, and quite close to the freezing point, then they will release enough latent heat as they freeze, that the rest of the droplet will drip backwards over the wing and form clear ice. This is usually regarded as the most dangerous type of ice. The freezing can also happen immediately (particularly for smaller droplets at lower temperatures), and they form a white build-up on the leading edge of the wings and other surfaces, called rime ice.
The worst icing happens just below 0ºC, and icing can occur down to temperatures as cold as -45ºC, but it is a gradual drop off, and you would not expect any significantly dangerous ice below -23ºC. The SCWDs rarely get much colder than this before freezing in the cloud.
Convective clouds such as CBs are the worst for icing
, as they can hold large droplets using their strong updrafts, and have wild temperature changes allowing large SCWDs into colder sections where an airframe would be very prone to icing. Nimbostratus clouds can also hold medium sized droplets and produce moderate icing.

Once it starts climbing it will pass through the
transition altitude.
Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa.
So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting.
You would now speak of
flight level
; the transition levels can be found on SID plates.
This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure.
This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft.
If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the
transition level
(this is the lowest flight level
above
the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS.
A transition layer
is the space between the transition altitude and transition level.
If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting.
When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer.
In the case of this specific question:
The question states the aircraft is descending so the altimeter will be reset at the transition level.
Because the local QNH is 1009 (you came from a standard setting of 1013,25) you go from a higher pressure to a lower one.
This means that the altitude shown on the altimeter will decrease.",,72149,"When an aircraft departs it is flying on a QNH value. Once it starts climbing it will pass through the
transition altitude.
Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa.
So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting.
You would now speak of
flight level
; the transition levels can be found on SID plates.
This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure.
This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft.
If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the
transition level
(this is the lowest flight level
above
the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS.
A transition layer
is the space between the transition altitude and transition level.
If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting.
When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer.
In the case of this specific question:
The question states the aircraft is descending so the altimeter will be reset at the transition level.

Clear ice is dangerous mainly because it:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'is translucent and only forms at the leading edges.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'is not translucent and forms at the leading edges.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'spreads out and contains many air particles.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'is heavy and is difficult to remove from the aircraft surfaces.'}]",is heavy and is difficult to remove from the aircraft surfaces.,"Refer to figures.
Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
A hard and heavy layer of transparent ice is formed that spreads from the point of impact to areas further away on the structure. It may be difficult or sometimes impossible to completely remove this ice accretion using the aircraft de-icing equipment.

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool, often referred to as Cold Air Drop, is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - i
t’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air
in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
Cold-air drops, also known as cold pools, have the potential to form in various locations and during any season, but they are commonly associated with

(or freeze into ice crystals if cold enough).
This temperature is called the dew point.
In this question,
the
relative humidity
at the cloud base will obviously be
higher
than at the ground
, as the air is colder at height (unstable atmosphere means no inversion, and cumulus clouds would not begin to form otherwise). In fact, the relative humidity at the cloud base should be exactly 100%, as this is why the cloud is now forming in any air currents that have risen.
The dew point is slightly more complicated. It actually decreases slightly with altitude due to the decreasing pressure (and therefore postpones the saturation of the air mass a little at higher altitudes). Therefore
the
dew point
at the cloud base will be
lower
than at the ground.
Further information:
A parcel of air can hold a certain amount of water in vapour form. That amount depends on the temperature of the parcel of air. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than colder air. When a parcel of air becomes overfilled with water vapour,
the excess water will begin to
condense
into water droplets
, which forms clouds, fog and dew. This most often occurs because the air parcel cools down for some reason, and therefore can no longer hold the water vapour that was already inside it, and as it cools, more and more water is released to condense into droplets.
A parcel of air's water vapour content is its absolute humidity (the actual amount of water vapour present). A more useful metric is its
relative humidity
though, and this is its
water vapour content
, as
a
percentage of its maximum (saturated)
water vapour content.
When a parcel of air cools down without adding or losing water vapour, its relative humidity increases, because the colder air has a lower maximum humidity (saturation point). When the relative humidity of an air parcel reaches 100%, the air is saturated, and the water begins to condense into droplets if any further water is added, or any cooling occurs.",,86013,"There is a temperature which, if a parcel of air cools down to it, the relative humidity will reach 100%, causing the water to begin to condense into droplets

, which forms clouds, fog and dew. This most often occurs because the air parcel cools down for some reason, and therefore can no longer hold the water vapour that was already inside it, and as it cools, more and more water is released to condense into droplets.
A parcel of air's water vapour content is its absolute humidity (the actual amount of water vapour present). A more useful metric is its
relative humidity
though, and this is its
water vapour content
, as
a
percentage of its maximum (saturated)
water vapour content.
When a parcel of air cools down without adding or losing water vapour, its relative humidity increases, because the colder air has a lower maximum humidity (saturation point). When the relative humidity of an air parcel reaches 100%, the air is saturated, and the water begins to condense into droplets if any further water is added, or any cooling occurs."

Insolation
The Sun provides the energy that heats the Earth and its atmosphere by a process of insolation (incoming solar radiation). Approximately half of the total radiation reaches, and is absorbed by, the Earth’s surface with the rest being absorbed by the atmosphere or re-radiated into space by scattering and reflection.
Terrestrial Radiation
The Earth radiates energy into the atmosphere in the form of terrestrial radiation.
It is more readily absorbed by the atmosphere especially by clouds, water vapour and carbon dioxide that solar radiation due to its longer wavelength
. The absorption of heat by the atmosphere from the Earth is the main heat exchange mechanism that causes weather. Any terrestrial radiation not absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere escapes back into space.

Insolation
: sun warms the Earth;
Radiation
: Earth loses heat, radiates heat.

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+20) × (3 000/1000) =

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate
(if not provided by the question)
.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

An occluded front is formed when a cold front and a warm front merge together. Usually, a cold front will catch up with the preceding warm front, and the warm sector of air will be trapped, and lifted up from the surface.
An occlusion usually takes on the form of both fronts in quick succession, and the weather in the central part of the occlusion will be decided by the type of occlusion, warm or cold.
The type of occlusion is simply which front stays connected to the ground. If the warm front remains intact, and the cold front ""rides"" up it, then the warm front is still touching the ground, and it is a warm occlusion. The frontal weather acts more like a warm front in this case, and the majority of the rain occurs before the front hits, and
the weather will gradually clear
after the surface front has passed.
On the other hand, if
the cold front forces the warm front up
, then the occlusion is a
cold occlusion

the majority of the rain falls just after the surface front has passed.
The type of occlusion depends on which sector of air is coldest
. Of course, the warmest sector is forced upwards in between two colder sectors of air. If the back sector is coldest, then it will be a cold occlusion. If the front section is the coldest, then the back section will be comparatively warm, and a warm occlusion will form.

On a night of clear skies with calm or light surface wind, a temperature inversion can form due to surface cooling- which can lead to windshear.
Be prepared to encounter this situation when taking off or landing in calm wind under clear skies within a few hours before or after sunrise.
- How does it happen?
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that
below an inversion, the wind speed will be light
and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm and the stronger winds above.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. The aircraft is most likely climbing after take off or approaching to land when passing through the inversion, which means that the airspeed is most probably slow - only a few knots greater than stall speed. The fluctuation in airspeed can induce a stall precariously close to the ground.
Since surface wind is calm or very light, take off or landing can be in any direction.
Takeoff may be in the direction of the wind above the inversion. If so, the aircraft encounters a sudden tailwind and a corresponding loss of airspeed when climbing through the inversion. Stall is possible.
If approach is into the wind above the inversion, the headwind is suddenly lost when descending through the inversion.

What are the benefits of flying in the lower Stratosphere?1. Low fuel consumption.  2. Less drag.  3. Less turbulence.  4. Fewer clouds.  5.

Whether an aircraft flies in the stratosphere or not largely depends on the type of aircraft.

Some of the reasons why it is advantageous for aeroplanes to fly in the lower stratosphere are listed below.
FUEL ECONOMY
.  At around 35 000 - 42 000 feet, which is the altitude that commercial airliners like to operate in, a very low amount of oxygen is required for proper combustion in the jet engines. An airplane flying in the stratosphere uses far less fuel than at lower altitudes thanks to the lower air density and lower temperature.
The air temperature drops 2°C for every 1 000 feet an airplane climbs – up to about 36 000 feet. This results in big savings for the airline and other operators.
LESS TURBULENCE
. Generally speaking, much of the weather phenomenon we see on Earth occurs in the troposphere, therefore an airplane flying in the stratosphere can avoid the bad weather that is typically found lower in the atmosphere. If you’ve wondered why you don’t see any clouds in the stratosphere it’s because the air contains very little water vapor, so clouds are unable to form.

WARM FRONT. Can be defined as warm air replacing cold air.
The warm, less dense air is overtaking/displacing the cold air => warm air will ride up and over the denser cold air while advancing. The air behind the warm front is warmer and moister than the air ahead of it (when the front passes, the air becomes warmer and more humid).
The slope of the warm air is approximately 1:100 to 1:150.
Warm front is slower than a cold front. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to 2/3 of the geostrophic interval measured along the front.
The warm air is mostly stable, the clouds that form are mostly stratiform.

Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges
(warm katabatic wind)
.
This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31749""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=DB73E035-A19A-46DB-8136-560B902FF9D4&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/DB73E035-A19A-46DB-8136-560B902FF9D4"" alt=""thumb_225_Foehn_EFFECT.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73364,".

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. Next, we will explore NE and SW Monsoons.
NE MONSOON
:
In winter – December, January and February
, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has
a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms
, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The
SW Monsoon affects all of India
, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer42190""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=BDC026D3-0057-4526-B6A1-F5337BE302B0&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/BDC026D3-0057-4526-B6A1-F5337BE302B0"" alt=""thumb_177_32_NE.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer42191""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=5B5B1FE8-11C8-4ED6-BAD2-79C70F1B7AC1&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/5B5B1FE8-11C8-4ED6-BAD2-79C70F1B7AC1"" alt=""thumb_568_141_SW .png"" /> </a> </div></div>",81042,"s.

An aircraft is flying over Everest at FL390. The temperature at FL390 is -48ºC and the local QNH at a station located at 5 000 ft equals 1013 hPa. The peak of Mount Everest is 29 029 ft. What is the aircraft's clearance above the peak of the mountain?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '11 127 ft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '10 310 ft'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '11 297 ft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '11 875 ft'}]",11 127 ft,"Refer to figure.
True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore,
pressure correction is disregarded
.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL390). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at FL390 is -56.5ºC (since it is below ISA tropopause). The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-48 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of
ISA +8.5ºC
.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +8.5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (8.5) × (34 000/1000) =
1 156 ft
.
The temperature correction is added the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of
­­­­­40 156 ft
.
Therefore, the height above ground = 40 156 ft - 29 029 ft =
11 127 ft
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×

If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

Ice crystal icing (ICI
) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (

). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected.
Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions
. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces
because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.

Mountain Waves is the phenomenon being described by the question.
MOUNTAIN WAVES are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side.

The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.

How does a Valley Inversion form?
The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.
Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON
:
In winter
– December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON
:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON
:
In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator.
As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon
. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon).
The SW Monsoon affects all of India
, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud.

"Due to a rapid depressurization the crew of a commercial jet aircraft has to rapidly descend and return to the departure airport.

QNH
- The pressure set on the subscale of the altimeter so that the instrument indicates its height above sea level. The altimeter will read runway elevation when the aircraft is on the runway.
Therefore, with local QNH set in our altimeter, when on the ground, it will read elevation = 224 feet.
When descending below the transition level, the pilot starts to refer to altitude of the aircraft by setting the altimeter to the QNH for the region or airfield (in this case, 1030 hPa).
Falling to do so, and, therefore, remaining on standard pressure of 1013 hPa, would mean that the new pressure reference is:
1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa
17 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =
459 ft
above sea level.
When on the ground, the altimeter will, therefore, indicate 459 ft less than field elevation: 224 ft - 459 ft =
-235 ft
Remember, we are on the ground with a pressure setting of 1013 when the qnh is 1030 => If we were to wind the altimeter forward, we would see the altitude increasing to eventually read aerodrome elevation of 224 feet when it is set correctly.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer32025""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=E854514B-500C-47E8-B9DF-01FBACA22527&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/E854514B-500C-47E8-B9DF-01FBACA22527"" alt=""thumb_542_503945.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",66445,".

Firstly, it is important to point out that this is a Contour chart and pressure information is not provided - Pressure is constant everywhere
=> this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level, in ISA conditions, corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations).
Isohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed) ,then we can assume a low pressure.
Having that established, it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts.
The closer the contours the stronger the wind.
Circulation of air around a High and Low Pressure system:
In the Northern Hemisphere:
- The air moves anticlockwise around a low pressure centr

LIGHTNING is a huge electrical discharge that flows between clouds, from a cloud to air, or from a cloud to the ground.
It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10°C and -10°C.
Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory. This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.
While flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge
The main effects of a lightning strike are:
Temporary blindness of the pilots
Minor airframe damage
Magnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked

low pressure systems in temperate latitudes.

RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly autumn and winter.
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM
Little clouds or clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground.
High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and
condensation.
Calm or very light wind – which will result in rapid cooling. 2 - 8 kt to mix the layers of air causing turbulence => promotes a thicker layer.
Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a better heat conductor than sea surface.

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature.
Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise.
When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly.
The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows:
The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it.
As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction.
Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.
The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called ""thermals."" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and
higher
up into the atmosphere the
convection
extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.)

During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point.

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -
They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
=> The weather activity within a cold pool is usually greatest in the afternoon, due to radiation and consequent warming of ground surfaces
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer28590""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=481D456A-8F2F-41C4-8D27-D20CFBDD7456&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/481D456A-8F2F-41C4-8D27-D20CFBDD7456"" alt=""thumb_125_507093.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73363,".

A katabatic wind
is caused by a ﬂow of cold air
down a hill or mountain side at night,
when the highlands radiate heat and are cooled.
The air in contact with the higher-level ground is also cooled, and it becomes denser than the air at the same elevation but away from the slope; it, therefore, begins to flow downhill.
The katabatic eﬀect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack.
In valleys, inversions are also called cold-air pools and form as a result of both cooling of the ground due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds (Katabatic winds).
The colder air which flows down the valley walls may “collect” at the bottom of the valley, creating a cold pool of air near the surface and low temperatures on the ground. They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale

A Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) is the type that forms storms. For a CB to form, there must be three things;
instability, moisture, and a trigger
(something which forces air to rise). When the cloud forms and the air is rising in an unstable air mass, the rising air does not cool down at the same rate as the surrounding environment, and this is what we call instability. This means that
the rising air wants to continue rising with more and more velocity.
When instability and moisture are great enough, these clouds can form large CBs, which continue to accelerate as long as instability exists. If the air becomes more stable, then the cloud's development will slow down (as it no longer has as much of a temperature difference with the surrounding air.
This is
most commonly seen at the tropopause
, where the surrounding air temperature stops changing (an isothermal layer), and all CBs are stopped at the tropopause, flowing outwards to form an ""anvil"" shape (sometimes overshooting with a small ""hat"" from the excess velocity).
Isothermal layers are inherently very stable
, as the rising air cools as it rises, so will never be the same temperature as air which remains the same temperature. This means that
inversions are even more stable.
Stability is based on the environmental lapse rate (ELR - the rate at which the surrounding air cools with temperature) vs the Dry or Wet Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR or SALR) of the rising parcel of air. The DALR is constant and the SALR is close to constant, but the ELR varies massively. The greater the ELR (greater temperature drop per 1000 ft), the less stable the atmosphere.
When the ELR is 0 (isothermal layer), or an inversion occurs, the air is absolutely stable.
A strong inversion in the mid layers of the troposphere (so 10 - 20,000 ft) would
stop a CB's development
very quickly indeed
. All of a sudden, the rising air in the CB would not be warmer than the surrounding air, and would stop or sink instead of rising.
The cloud would have no further development above this point.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer53888""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=47A64CA5-CBB6-4C8B-862E-689E01C56941&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/47A64CA5-CBB6-4C8B-862E-689E01C56941"" alt=""thumb_202303151227_CB-with-flat-top.jpg"" /> </a> </div></div>",85842,".

"You must make an emergency landing at sea. The QNH of a field on a nearby island with an elevation of 4 000 ft is 1025 hPa and the temperature is -20°C. What is your pressure altimeter reading when landing if 1025 hPa is set in the subscale?

This question is based upon you knowing the relationship between QFF and QNH.
QFE is the pressure at the station (or aerodrome) level.
QNH is the mean sea level pressure, derived by applying ICAO's standard atmosphere corrections to QFE.
QFF is the mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the
actual temperature conditions.
Considering the above definitions, we can say that, in ICAO's standard atmosphere, when landing at sea level with QNH set on your altimeter - it will read ""0 ft"".
Now, this question states that actual temperature at 4 000 ft is -20ºC - Which means that the air is 27ºC
colder than ISA
(ISA temperature at 4000 ft = 15 - 2 x 4 = 7ºC).
=> Normally, a standard lapse rate of 1 hPa per 27 ft is used to calculate the difference between QNH and QFE. However, in cold and dense air, pressure changes more rapidly and the pressure change will be more than that. Thus
in colder than standard temperature QFF is more than QNH.
Since the QFF (actual pressure at MSL) will be higher than the QNH, when the aircraft reaches MSL, the ambient pressure will be higher than the value set on the altimeter (QNH), therefore,
it will indicate a value less than zero.
Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

Troposphere
= The lowest layer of our atmosphere.It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level.Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.
Stratosphere
= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.
Mesosphere
= The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here.
Thermosphere
= The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km.The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees.

Troposphere
= The lowest layer of our atmosphere.It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level.Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.
Stratosphere
= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.
Mesosphere
= The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here.

Lapse rate means the rate at which temperature changes with height.
Positive lapse rate means a decrease in temperature with height.
For unsaturated air, the lapse rate is 3°C per 1000 feet; this is called the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate
(DALR
).
However, when the parcel of air reaches its dewpoint (100% humidity) and becomes saturated, water vapour condenses, latent heat is released during the condensation process, which warms the air, and the lapse rate reduces to 1.8°C per thousand feet
(SALR).
At higher altitudes and latitudes, where there is generally less water content in the air, and therefore less latent heat to release, the SALR is closer to 3°C per thousand feet.

is caused by physical obstructions to the normal ﬂow of air caused by the friction between the air and the ground, especially irregular terrain (such as hills, mountains, coasts, trees) and man-made obstacles. It occurs within the friction layer
(2000-3000ft),
and its intensity depends on:
The strength of the surface wind;
The nature of the surface; and
The stability of the air.
The stronger the wind speed (generally, a surface wind of 20 kts or higher is required for significant turbulence), the rougher the terrain (hilly terrain) and the more unstable (CU indicate instability) the air => the greater will be the turbulence."
Which of the following is most likely to occur in a cold air pool?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'A temperature inversion.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'A jet stream.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Altocumulus lenticularis.'}]",A temperature inversion.,"Refer to figure.
COLD AIR POOL
Cold air pools often form in topographic depressions, such as a valleys or basins, filled with cold air.
The cold air is heavy and settles to the bottom of the depression. This air can remain stagnant, trapped by the surrounding higher terrain, resulting in long periods of poor air quality and fog, depending on the sources of pollution and amount of moisture in the air, respectively.
Where the temperature increases with an increase in height,
then we have what is called a temperature inversion
: vertical mixing is inhibited and below an inversion the wind speed will be light with a significantly different direction to the much stronger wind above the inversion. Hence windshear will occur at the inversion. An aircraft climbing or descending through the inversion will experience a rapid change in speed and direction which can lead to turbulence.

What is the diameter of an average tornado?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '100 to 150 metres.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Only a few metres.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'In the order of 10 km.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'About 2 to 6 km.'}]",100 to 150 metres.,"Refer to figure.
A TORNADO is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction.
Characteristics:
Tornadoes are associated with Cumulonimbus and large Cumulus clouds. Large
super-cell thunderstorms
are most likely to produce them.
The highest incidence is in the southern states of the USA (tornado alley) in the spring and early summer - very warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, moving north, meets relatively cold air coming from the northwest - which gives the massive instability and the windshear required.
They can last from several seconds up to (roughly) 30 minutes, in absolutely extreme cases they can even last over an hour - however, most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes
Its speed of movement usually ranges from 20 - 40 kts and may have rotational speeds in excess of 200 kt.
Averaging about 100 m in diameter
(maximums are difficult to say, as the largest ever recorded was reported to be 4 km wide, but it is extremely rare to get them over even 1 km wide)

A TORNADO is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction.
Characteristics:
Tornadoes are associated with Cumulonimbus and large Cumulus clouds. Large
super-cell thunderstorms
are most likely to produce them.
The highest incidence is in the southern states of the USA (tornado alley) in the spring and early summer - very warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, moving north, meets relatively cold air coming from the northwest - which gives the massive instability and the windshear required.
They can last from several seconds up to (roughly) 30 minutes, in absolutely extreme cases they can even last over an hour - however, most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes
Its speed of movement usually ranges from 20 - 40 kts and may have rotational speeds in excess of 200 kt.
Averaging about 100 m in diameter
(maximums are difficult to say, as the largest ever recorded was reported to be 4 km wide, but it is extremely rare to get them over even 1 km wide)

Within Europe, tornadoes are much weaker systems whose maximum diameter is of the order of

Icing conditions are
mostly
present within clouds below freezing temperature (0ºC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a ""supercooled"" state, in that their temperature is less than 0ºC, but they are still liquid. We call them Supercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs). When an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze, adhering to the airframe in the process.
For this question though, we have very little information, so have had to take some of the ""edge cases"" into account.
Icing can also occur when the water droplets are close to freezing, but still just above
,
as long as the airframe is colder than freezing.
The slightly warmer water droplets will freeze upon hitting the colder airframe. In fact, this icing can be particularly dangerous, as it drips back over the wing very easily, forming clear ice. This can happen when the wings are ""cold-soaked"", and in some parts of the rain-ice triangle as well.
This is why we have said that icing can form with
outside air temperatures of 10ºC or colder
, as we know that it occasionally can, and this is the classification of icing conditions for most operators/aircraft, but that is partly due to SAT vs TAT and RAM rise. We think this is on the ""safe side"", which is where EASA examiners usually sit on this kind of topic.

Let's go through the options:
""Severe turbulence inside alto-lenticularis clouds.""
Whilst lenticular clouds do cause very strong wind shear and turbulence if a pilot goes too close to them or goes inside them, they are not a very common occurrence, as the winds and atmospheric conditions have to be within certain parameters for the mountain waves to form at all, and then a further set of conditions for lenticular clouds to form. Therefore,
it would be unnecessary to brief them without knowing they are present
, and they primarily occur in clear weather, so can be seen and avoided if necessary.
""Fog formation due to moist air descending into the valley.""
Fog can form in the bottom of valleys, but this is due to the cold air from the mountainside flowing down into the valley, usually
during the night.
It is not something you can expect every time you fly into a valley, certain conditions have to exist. We do not have enough information to assume that this might be happening.
""Turbulence on the windward side of the hills due to up and down draughts.""
Whilst you can expect some turbulence on the windward side of a hill, it is primarily due to the air being forced upwards by the wind hitting the terrain, and therefore just updraughts. The airfield is also surrounded by mountains, so is
on the leeward side of each mountain, not the windward side.
""Rotor turbulence which could lead to loss of control.""
Most correct.
The rotor effects from winds going over mountains are incredibly common to observe, as they require a wind to be blowing, so happen almost all the time. They also form a lot of turbulence, particularly when the winds are strong, and are a good item to brief when descending into mountainous terrain.",,85610,"This question gives us very litte information, and we must choose the most correct answer out of the 4 options, which primarily requires us to understand the rough probabilities of a phenomenon occurring.

TURBULENCE
Within the friction layer, we can identify two types of turbulence:
MECHANICAL/FRICTIONAL TURBULENCE
Friction between the air and the ground
, especially irregular terrain and man-made obstacles (such as hills, mountains, coasts, trees and buildings
)
, causes eddies and therefore turbulence in the lower levels.
- This kind of turbulence will increase as the wind speed increases.
Convective/Thermal Turbulence
Expected on warm summer days when the sun heats the earth's surface unevenly. Certain surfaces, such as barren ground, rocky and sandy areas, are heated more rapidly than are grass covered fields and much more rapidly than is water. Insolation gives rise to convection currents - with warm air rising and cooler air descending, which are responsible for bumpy conditions as an airplane flies in and out of them.
- Thermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 hrs on clear sunny days - In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31847""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=0CFAF7E8-B986-4E3C-BC51-5695B4F37C1C&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/0CFAF7E8-B986-4E3C-BC51-5695B4F37C1C"" alt=""thumb_164_108_506295.PNG"" /> </a> </div></div>",72890,".

temperatures would decrease.
Note: Above the cold sector tropopause the temperature remains constant. But on the warm sector, temperatures will continue to decrease until it reaches the tropopause. Which means that above the jet core, temperatures are colder in the warm sector.

Which of the following statements is/are correct?1. Polar lows are formed over water only  2. Thermal lows are formed over land only,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '1 only'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'None'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '1 and 2'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '2 only'}]",1 only,"See the comments - conflicting feedback.
Refer to figure.
(1) Polar lows are formed over water only
.
CORRECT
.
Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours.
Like their tropical cousins, polar lows
tend to decay rapidly with landfall
, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This is the reason that they do not occur naturally over land (see note below).
(2) Thermal lows are formed over land
only.
INCORRECT
.
Thermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong.
Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area.
Thermal lows are most common over land masses but
they can form over water
when the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season.
Note: this question is very highly contested, and it seems that some authorities disagree on the correct answer. For instance
the Polish and Hungarian authority believe that ""1 only"" is the wrong answer and we believe that they choose ""both correct"" as the correct answer
, even though we have good feedback from other authorities that ""1 only"" correct.
We say that the
second most correct answer is ""none""
, as there can be debate as to the formation of polar lows; where they usually form over water, could they occur completely over land? We have to go off the exam feedback, and so would appreciate any further feedback on this question in the comments, or sent to info@atplquestions.com.

The pressure altitude and the true altitude will be equal only when standard atmospheric conditions exist, i.e. there is no temperature deviation from ISA and the pressure at sea level is 1013 hPa.
To calculate the pressure adjustment, we apply the correction of 30 ft for each 1 hPa difference between QNH and 1013 hPa. Thus, if the actual QNH (pressure) in the area we are flying over is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than the indicated altitude.

How can freezing fog occur?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'The fog can form by any usual process but it becomes freezing fog when the temperature is below 0 °C.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'By advection between the 60°N and higher latitudes.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'By advection when the wind speed is between 5-10 kt and the OAT is between 0°C and 5°C.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'By radiation in the early mornings.'}]",The fog can form by any usual process but it becomes freezing fog when the temperature is below 0 °C.,"FREEZING FOG.
In its simplest sense, fog is a cloud near the ground that consists of tiny liquid water droplets. Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or when the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated.
Freezing fog occurs when fog forms at temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain liquid. They become supercooled water droplets (SCWDs) remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This is the same process as having SCWD within a cloud.
This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals are formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind, or on the leading edge of a wing that flies through it.
Freezing fog can cause ice accumulation on the aircraft and the ground, so is also a dangerous weather phenomenon if not treated correctly.",,82184,"FREEZING FOG.

MOUNTAIN/LEE WAVES/STANDING WAVES develop on the lee, or downwind, side of mountains.
The most severe turbulence associated with Mountain waves can occur in the Rotor Zone
, lying beneath the crests of lee waves - often marked by Rotor/roll clouds. The most powerful rotor lies beneath the first wave crest (one wavelength downwind)
These waves are generated when:
Wind direction: generally perpendicular (+/-30º) fashion, raised up over the mountains. And no significant change in direction with altitude.
Wind speed: strong. At least 20 kt, increasing with altitude, at the summits.
Marked layer of stability/strong inversion around altitude of summits – which will work as a barrier over the mountains.
Cloud Formation associated with Mountain Waves
Lenticular clouds (lens shaped clouds) can form in the crest of the mountain waves.
Rotor/Roll Clouds can also occur in the rotors below the waves.

The exact weather of a stationary front depends greatly on the characteristics of its constituent air masses - their moisture levels, for example - and the general instability of the local atmosphere. Often, however, conditions resemble those encountered along warm front weather:

The temperature on the lee side is normally higher than on the windward side of the mountain at the same level.,"Refer to figure.
FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes
of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.
In terms of weather, we can expect:
• Upwind side: clouds, precipitation and poor visibility,
• Downwind side: clear skies, good visibility, turbulence.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer56594""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=f4658fa1-7599-465c-8e8c-2b1f9d7eeb35&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/f4658fa1-7599-465c-8e8c-2b1f9d7eeb35"" alt=""thumb_202308180846_050-122-1.jpg"" /> </a> </div></div>",72387,".

FRONTAL FOG
.
Occurs at a warm front or occlusion
. The main cause – precipitation lowering the cloud base to the ground. Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night.
The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours.
Note: Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low.
ADVECTION FOG.
Is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion.

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool, often referred to as Cold Air Drop, is a
low pressure system
, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a
cooler-than-normal pocket of air
in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart
and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -
They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer37595""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=AA314EBF-8336-4C4C-B1E5-8CDBD6DD95DA&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/AA314EBF-8336-4C4C-B1E5-8CDBD6DD95DA"" alt=""thumb_704_464_501249.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",66343,".

You are planning a flight from Barcelona to Castres in Southern France. The planned route will take you over the eastern end of the Pyrenees with a maximum terrain elevation of 8000 feet. Your flight is planned at 9500 feet. As you approach the Pyrenees from the south you notice small lens shaped clouds on your track ahead. What is your best course of action?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'The lens shaped clouds indicate a stable atmosphere, therefore, the air will be smooth, no action will be required and the flight can continue as planned.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'The lens shaped clouds indicate mountain wave activity, climbing to 11,500 feet will avoid this.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'The pilot should divert to the east and go around the mountains.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': ""Continue flight at the planned level. Secure all loose objects in the cabin, get the passengers to fasten/tighten their seatbelts and warn them it's going to get rough.""}]",The pilot should divert to the east and go around the mountains.,"Refer to figure.
The lens shaped clouds in this question are
lenticular clouds
, which are strange looking clouds which hover in place, and are indicative of
mountain wave activity
. Mountain waves are very violent updrafts and downdrafts that occcur above, and downstream of, mountain ranges. In particular, the area insde and underneath a lenticular cloud contains extremely violent
rotor turbulence effects
, and should never be flown close to. When at only 1500ft above the maximum terrain elevation, the downdrafts from these mountain waves could easily overpower a piston aircraft's maximum rate of climb, causing potential
terrain clearance issues
also.
Another problem with mountain waves is that they can, in the right conditions, c
ontinue upwards for tens of thousands of feet
, up as high as the tropopause in some cases. This means that attempting to climb above them is a dangerous gamble, with potential for severe clear air turbulence, certainly not worth it, especially in this case. Sometimes the lenticular clouds will form in higher mountain wave layers, stacking up; sometimes they will not. If there are lenticular clouds around 9500ft, there will almost certainly be a lot of turbulence around 11,500ft also.
This track from Barcelona to Castres goes over the Eastern Pyrenees, and if you were to go
a few more miles East
, you would be
out of the mountain range area

not an excessive diversion
to make, and so could be completed safely.

MOUNTAIN WAVES.
Oscillations to the lee side (downwind)
of high ground resulting from the disturbance in the horizontal air flow caused by the high ground.
Mountain waves are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side.
This develops a series of standing waves downstream
from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water.
With regards to this question
, if we are flying towards a mountain range experiencing a tailwind => it is likely that we will encounter an updraft as we approach the mountain. On the other hand, when
experiencing headwind, it means that the wind is blowing over the mountain and towards the aircraft => it it likely that we will encounter a down draft
(a dangerous situation, especially if flying a low performance aircraft - we might not be able to overcome this downdraft).
Alternatively, you can think of it this way: if you fly towards a mountain with tailwind, it means that the wind is also going towards the mountains, therefore, you are on the upwind of the mountain and not on the lee side (wind encounters the mountain from the same side as you).
Flying towards a mountain with headwind, means that you are approaching the lee side of the mountain => where mountain waves occur and turbulence may be severe.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31948""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=EBF94277-90AA-41AA-BD17-2BFA209D3C15&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/EBF94277-90AA-41AA-BD17-2BFA209D3C15"" alt=""thumb_536_694_505848-01.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72335,".

Mountain waves are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side.
This develops a series of standing waves downstream
from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water.
With regards to this question
, if we are flying towards a mountain range experiencing a tailwind => it is likely that we will encounter an updraft as we approach the mountain. On the other hand, when
experiencing headwind, it means that the wind is blowing over the mountain and towards the aircraft => it it likely that we will encounter a down draft
(a dangerous situation, especially if flying a low performance aircraft - we might not be able to overcome this downdraft).
Alternatively, you can think of it this way: if you fly towards a mountain with tailwind, it means that the wind is also going towards the mountains, therefore, you are on the upwind of the mountain and not on the lee side (wind encounters the mountain from the same side as you).
Flying towards a mountain with headwind, means that you are approaching the lee side of the mountain => where mountain waves occur and turbulence may be severe."

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze
.
Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze
(they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.

In this scenario, the aircraft has a very cold airframe, which will warm up quite fast during the descent and landing. The fuel, however, has a much larger thermal mass than the airframe, and will take much longer to warm up.
This means that the wings are what we refer to as ""

Which of the following statements is/are correct?1. Polar lows are formed over water only.  2.

.
CORRECT
.
Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours.
Like their tropical cousins, polar lows
tend to decay rapidly with landfall
, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This may well be the reason that they do not occur naturally over land.
(2) Thermal lows are
mainly
formed over land
.
CORRECT
.
Thermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong.
Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via re-radiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area.
Thermal lows are most common over land masses
but
they can form over water
when the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season.

Along the West coast of India the prevailing winds are the:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'NE monsoon in July and a SW monsoon in January.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'SW monsoon in July and a NE monsoon in January.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'SW monsoon in July and a SE monsoon in January.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'SE monsoon in July and a SW monsoon in January.'}]",SW monsoon in July and a NE monsoon in January.,"Refer to figures.
MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON
:
In winter – December, January and February
, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over
central India
, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon).

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON
:
In winter – December, January and February
, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over
central India
, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The
SW Monsoon affects all of India
, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm."

An inversion is a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere - where temperature increases with an increase in height.
The rain falling from the Nimbostratus cloud at 7ºC, will be quite warm. However, in this situation, because of the temperature inversion, the temperature decreases as altitude reduces. Falling through cold air (between 5 000 ft and 2 000 ft), the droplets become supercooled.

Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in
high altitude
due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (
often referred to as ""sublimation"" in meteorology
).
Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected
.
Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions
. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.
The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud, such as Cb - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer37502""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=D872B578-E075-40D3-921C-6846D1F59870&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/D872B578-E075-40D3-921C-6846D1F59870"" alt=""thumb_717_51_636_509271 (2).png"" /> </a> </div></div>",77712,".

COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50 - 100 NM

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Freezing Rain
occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C
Freezing Rain can cause significant accumulations
of clear ice
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore,
pressure correction is disregarded
.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (34 000/1000) =

CAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is very much guesswork, and CAT can appear in unexpected places with no warning.

If a
large supercooled water droplet
strikes an aircraft, it will start to freeze and this will
release latent heat
. This will delay the freezing process whilst part of the supercooled water droplet will
flow back over the impact surface

Clear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing.
The ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the build-up can be uneven. It is illustrated in

Propeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage.

often form in topographic
depressions

fog

pollution
and amount of
moisture
in the air, respectively.

increases

below

speed will be
light

stronger wind above

will occur at the inversion.

A STATIONARY front forms when a cold front or warm front stops moving. This happens when two masses of air are pushing against each other but neither is powerful enough to move the other.
The situation can be described winds blowing parallel to the front instead of perpendicular can help it stay in place.
The exact weather of a stationary front depends greatly on the characteristics of its constituent air masses - their moisture levels, for example - and the general instability of the local atmosphere. Often, however, conditions resemble those encountered along warm front weather:
extensive cloudiness and continuous rain

A STATIONARY front forms when a cold front or warm front stops moving. This happens when two masses of air are pushing against each other but neither is powerful enough to move the other.
The situation can be described winds blowing parallel to the front instead of perpendicular can help it stay in place.
The exact weather of a stationary front depends greatly on the characteristics of its constituent air masses - their moisture levels, for example - and the general instability of the local atmosphere. Often, however, conditions resemble those encountered along warm front weather:
extensive cloudiness and continuous rain

The
Sun provides the energy that heats the Earth
and its atmosphere by a process of
insolation

the surface of the Earth warms up, and produces longer wave radiation (
infrared
radiation)

The greenhouse effect is how the Earth manages to keep its heat in.

TROPOPAUSE
The tropopause is the upper limit of the troposphere and, therefore, constitutes the boundary between it and the Stratosphere and
it is where the temperature remains almost constant with further increase in height
(temperature ceases to fall with increasing height). To put this into prespective, when we reach the tropopause, the
temperature lapse rate changes from 2ºC/1 000 ft to less than two-thirds of 1ºC/1 000 ft
. This is what they mean by ""abrupt change"".
As you can see in the attached figure, in the troposphere, the temperature first decreases with altitude. In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere.

"You are flying over the sea at FL250 and measure an outside temperature of -50°C. The pressure at sea level is 1023 hPa.What is your approximate true altitude calculated using normal vertical change in temperature with increase in height?
(Note: assume 1 hPa = 27 ft)","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '26 770 ft AMSL.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '26 230 ft AMSL.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '23 770 ft AMSL.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '23 230 ft AMSL.'}]",23 770 ft AMSL.,"Refer to figure.
True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1023 hPa - 1013 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­
270 ft
. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude
= 25 000 ft + 270 ft =
25 270
ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (25 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-35 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-50 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of
ISA -15ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (25 270/1000) =
-1 516 ft
.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 25 270 ft - 1 516 ft =
­­­­­23 754 ft
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate
(if not provided by the question)
.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×
Indicated alt/1000
=

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1023 hPa - 1013 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­
270 ft
. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude
= 25 000 ft + 270 ft =
25 270
ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (25 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-35 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-50 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of
ISA -15ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (25 270/1000) =
-1 516 ft
.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 25 270 ft - 1 516 ft =
­­­­­23 754 ft
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate
(if not provided by the question)
.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.

WEATHER ATTENUATION
The weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a ""shadowing"" effect occurs.
The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,
Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.
Tip for avoiding shadows:
To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.
If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 16 200 ft
(14 200 + 2 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6 500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (6 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-23ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -25ºC.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -25ºC
. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 200 ft - 6 500 ft =
9 700 ft
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-25) × (9 700/1000) =
-970
ft

In this case, the temperature correction is
added to
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­17 170 ft
.
The minimum indicated altitude in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2000 ft is
17200 ft
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 16 200 ft
(14 200 + 2 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6 500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (6 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-23ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -25ºC.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -25ºC
. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 200 ft - 6 500 ft =
9 700 ft
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-25) × (9 700/1000) =
-970
ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added to
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­17 170 ft
.
The minimum indicated altitude in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2000 ft is
17200 ft
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×

On a night of clear skies with calm or light surface wind, a temperature inversion can form due to surface cooling
-
which can lead to windshear
.
Temperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above
.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion.
Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind =>
which causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in lift.
The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground.
Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,
the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines
(and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion,
temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreased aircraft performance
, leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air.

"An operator wants to fly a new route over a mountainous area with the highest nearby obstacle at 12 500 ft. According to a historical report, the average temperature in the region is ISA -25°C. The QNH is 980 hPa, from a station at sea level. What is the lowest usable flight level the operator can select with a clearance margin of 2 000 ft?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'FL140'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'FL160'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'FL170'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'FL150'}]",FL170,"Refer to figure.
Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 14 500 ft
(12 500 + 2 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -25ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-25) × (14 500/1000) =
-1 450
ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added to
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­15 950 ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 980 hPa = 33 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 33 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 990 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 15 950 ft + 990 ft =
16 940 ft
.
The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is

RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 10 000 ft - 690 ft =
9 310 ft
.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­0 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +
5ºC
.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 9 310 ft - 1 500 ft = 7 810 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (5) × (7 810/1000) =
156 ft
.
The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of
9 466 ft
.
Therefore, the height above ground = 9 466 ft - 5 000 ft =
4 466 ft
(4 500 ft is the closest option).
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

What type of clouds can one expect after a cold front has passed?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Cumulus clouds.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Cirrus clouds.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Cumulonimbus clouds.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Cirrostratus clouds.'}]",Cumulus clouds.,"Refer to figures.
COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.
A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.
Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns.
- Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation.
- An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.

Cumulus clouds are the most common

HOAR FROST
It occurs when a sub-zero surface comes into contact with moist air (the ambient temperature is lowered to saturation level).
It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air.
Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating).
This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles).
Hoar frost can occur:
on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.
in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases:
If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer.
If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion.
The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31273""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=01EFCA36-7BBE-4A0F-83A8-9A9835322C70&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/01EFCA36-7BBE-4A0F-83A8-9A9835322C70"" alt=""thumb_343_509448.jpg"" /> </a> </div></div>",73394,".

Learning Objective 050.01.01.02.04: Describe the variations of the FL and temperature of the tropopause from the poles to the equator.
The atmosphere is split up into many different layers. The lowest layer is the troposphere, followed by the stratosphere. In general, these are the two that pilots care about most. The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause, and is where the stratosphere begins.
The atmosphere is not always the same height though, in fact it varies wildly in height between the tropics and the poles.
Over the equator, the atmosphere is very tall
, due to both heat (meaning that pressure reduces at a lower rate with altitude) and other effects such as convection and general circulation of air.
The atmosphere over the poles has much less height
, this is mostly to do with the reduced convection and the cold air, which loses pressure more quickly with altitude.
The height of the troposphere (which is indicative of the atmosphere in general) will therefore change from season to season, as solar heating differs due to the angle of the sun to the ground.
In the winter season, in general a hemisphere will have a lower tropopause, and in the summer, a higher tropopause
. This also coincides with how close a particular place is to the ITCZ, the heat equator, which moves with the seasons.
In the tropics, the tropopause reaches around FL550 in summer, dropping a little in the winter, depending on where in the tropics.
At the poles, it can drop to as low as FL200 around the winter time, and up to around FL250 in the summer.
The
ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) has the tropopause at 36 090 ft

40-50º Latitude
(above this in summer, below it in winter). Therefore
FL250 to FL350

You are planning an IFR flight eastbound and find that the highest obstacle along the route has an elevation of 5400 ft. The ISA deviation is -20°C and QNH 990. What is the lowest usable flight level on this flight?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'FL080'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'FL060'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'FL090'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'FL070'}]",FL090,"Refer to figure.
Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
7 400 ft
(5 400 ft + 2 000 ft).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -20ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-20) × (7 400/1000) =
-592 ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added
to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­
7 992
ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa =
23 hPa
. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
690 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 7 992 ft + 690 ft =
8 682 ft
.
According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies an
easterly magnetic track
. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is:

RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

In the stratosphere, which is the layer of atmosphere above the troposphere, starting at 36,000 ft in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the
temperature stays the same
(
isothermal layer
) up to around 60,000ft, where it then begins to gradually increase again. The lower levels of the stratosphere would therefore be around the region of 36,000 to 50,000ft
This means that the lower levels of the stratosphere have decreasing pressure with height (the same occurs all through the atmosphere) but
the temperature remains the same (warmer than it would otherwise be)
. In the troposphere, the reduction in temperature with altitude allows some density to be regained (as cold air is denser), but this does not happen in the stratosphere, meaning that
the air density drops off quicker than it would in the corresponding troposphere.
This also means that the stratosphere is also completely stable due to the isothermal nature of it.
Let's go through each option individually:
Stratospheric flight levels have lower density (therefore higher density altitude) than if it were the troposphere, which means that the
jet engines can run at their peak efficiency
, as they are effectively at a higher altitude. This compounds with the fact that the stratospheric flight levels are high up anyway, giving them
very efficient flight characteristics
even without the effect of the isothermal layer.
The reduced density also gives a
higher TAS
when flying at a
constant IAS
, and the warmer temperature means that
TAS will be higher when flying at a constant Mach number
(which is much more likely).
Emissions within the stratosphere have been studied to have a
different impact
on the environment, but
not necessarily less of an impact
.
Mountain waves can extend well into the stratosphere in some cases, and EASA formally recognise that as part of the mountain waves syllabus.
There will be less clouds in the low stratosphere
, as cloud form due to uplift (mostly) which does not occur, and
the isothermal layer is completely stable.
There are some rare clouds that do occur (noctilucent, polar stratospheric, etc.), as well as the peaks of some violent CBs that penetrate the tropopause with their high upwards momentum.
Less wear on the engines is not true
, as the engines will have to spin at a
higher RPM
to maintain thrust output in the low density air (which is actually more efficient), but will cause
more wear
due to the high rotational speeds.
Less turbulence is probably the easiest one to work out of this whole selection, as this is what the stratosphere is best at,

An aircraft is flying at FL60. The pilots forget to switch to the standard pressure setting and remain instead on the local QNH of 1 025 hPa. Determine how much higher or lower the aircraft is comparing to the other aircraft at FL60 with the standard pressure setting correctly set.,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '300 ft lower.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '360 ft higher.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '300 ft higher.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '360 ft lower.'}]",360 ft lower.,"Refer to figure.
During climb, pilots change the altimeter to standard pressure (1013 hPa) when passing through the transition altitude. Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.
It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1025 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic.
Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure:
1025 – 1013 = 12 hPa
Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa:
12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft
The aircraft is 6 000 ft – 5 640 ft =
360 ft

During climb, pilots change the altimeter to standard pressure (1013 hPa) when passing through the transition altitude. Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.
It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1025 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic.
Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure:
1025 – 1013 = 12 hPa
Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa:
12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft
The aircraft is 6 000 ft – 5 640 ft =
360 ft
lower than remaining traffic.
Note 1: The local QNH (1025 hPa) is higher than the standard pressure (1013 hPa). This means that the local QNH datum is lower than the 1013 datum => the aircraft is lower than the remaining traffic.
Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used."

What is the approximate true altitude of an aircraft with an indicated altitude of 8 000 ft (with the correct QNH set in the subscale) and an OAT of +12°C?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '7680 ft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '7584 ft'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '8032 ft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '8416 ft'}]",8416 ft,"Refer to figure.
True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (8 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (8 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­-1ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+12ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA +13ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +13ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+13) × (8 000/1000) =

RULES.

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate
(if not provided by the question)
.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR
Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it.
It detects drops of precipitation

Reflectivity
Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity.
=> Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water.
In some modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence

When a polar front approaches a mountain range in southern Europe, the expected weather conditions can vary. However, there are some general patterns that can be observed.
Typically, as the polar front encounters the mountain range, it is forced to rise due to the barrier presented by the mountains.
As the air rises, it cools and condenses, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation

The interaction between the polar front and the mountain range can result in significant weather changes. Some of the common weather conditions associated with this scenario include:
Increased precipitation
: The forced ascent of the air along the mountain range can lead to enhanced precipitation, potentially causing heavy rainfall or snowfall.
Strong winds
: The interaction between the polar front and the mountains can generate strong and gusty winds, particularly in the vicinity of the mountain passes and slopes.
Thunderstorms
: The lifting of warm and moist air along the mountain range can contribute to the development of thunderstorms, especially if there is a strong contrast in air masses.

SURFACE WIND
The geostrophic wind at altitude flows perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, due to the coriolis force. The coriolis force only becomes effective when enough speed has been gained, and near the ground, this speed is continuously reduced by friction. This means that the wind speed at the surface less than the
free stream flow (geostrophic or gradient wind)
. We sometimes call this
free stream flow the ""2000 ft wind""
because the boundary layer of the surface friction has usually ended by that height, so the ""2000 ft wind"" is usually unaffected by the surface friction.
Surface wind is not just reduced in speed though, it is also
changed in direction due to the reduction in coriolis force
. This means that the surface wind will be more affected by the pressure gradient force (PGF) than the coriolis force (CF), so will flow towards the low pressure somewhat.
This means that
in the Northern Hemisphere, the surface wind is ""backed"" from the free stream wind
, to go towards the low pressure (and it is ""veered"" in the Southern Hemisphere).
The degree to the speed reduction and the subsequent direction change depends on
the

"Which of the following statements are correct/incorrect? 1. The actual temperature of an air mass is higher than the dew point temperature if the air mass is unsaturated.   2. For a saturated air mass, the dew point temperature over ice is lower than the dew point temperature over water.","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '1 is correct, 2 is correct.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '1 is correct, 2 is incorrect.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '1 is incorrect, 2 is correct.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '1 is incorrect, 2 is incorrect.'}]","1 is correct, 2 is incorrect.","“The actual temperature of an air mass is higher than the dew point temperature if the air mass is unsaturated."" CORRECT
Dew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for saturation to occur. When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated (relative humidity = 100%). Dew point temperature can
never be greater
than the air temperature. Therefore, if the air cools below the original dew point, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation.
Summary:
• for
unsaturated air – dew point is lower than air temperature
; and
• for saturated air – dew point is equal to air temperature.
""For a saturated air mass, the dew point temperature over ice is lower than the dew point temperature over water."" INCORRECT
This one is a bit more complicated, but in simple terms, if the air temperature is below the freezing point of water (0ºC) and therefore ice crystals can be formed instead of water droplets, then the air will
favour the formation of ice.
Due to the saturation vapour pressure over ice being lower than water, the amount of water vapour that can be held before forming ice crystals is LESS than can be held before forming water droplets.
This means that
ice crystals are formed
earlier
than water droplets
, so
ice has a
HIGHER temperature frost point
than water's
dew point.

FREEZING RAIN. The conditions needed for freezing rain are quite specific.

Humidity Measurement
Absolute Humidity
Refers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3
Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)
Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.
Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)
The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.
Expressed as g/kg of dry air.
Relative Humidity (RH)
The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.
Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.
RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100
RH 100% = Saturation
Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.
From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.
Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases.

We have had to assume that the
OAT is measured at the aircraft and that the QNH was measured at sea level
. These are not always the case, and were ambiguous in our feedback.
The aircraft's indicated altitude is 4500ft. We know that the
true altitude
of the highest obstacle is 3120 ft. We must therefore calculate the aircraft's true altitude from the indicated altitude, which is a simple matter of a temperature correction.
In an ISA atmosphere, the temperature at the aircraft's altitude (4500 ft) would be 15 - 2(4.5) = 6ºC. The actual outside air temperature is 4ºC, so the OAT is ISA -2ºC.
TEMPERATURE CORRECTION
A good way to remember this part is to think that
true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high
. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA.
==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude.
==>
When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.
As this scenario has an OAT of 2ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this.
Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA)
So for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 4.5 x 2 = 36 ft.

Lightning results when this electrical charge becomes strong enough to jump from the cloud to the ground,
to another cloud, or to an opposite electrical charge within the same cloud.

GEOSTROPHIC WIND - the pressure gradient force is equal to the Coriolis force. Which means that the effect of latitude must be accounted for.
Notice that the same spacing between isobars at high latitude gives a slower wind speed when compared to lower latitude.
Within 5º of the equator, the CF is close to zero.
Within 15º of the equator, the CF is very small, so the geostrophic wind formula is no longer valid

"You plan a flight over a mountain range at a true altitude of 15 000 ft AMSL. The air is on an average 15 °C colder than ISA, the pressure at sea level is 1003 hPa. What approximate indication should the altimeter (setting 1013.2 hPa) read?

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 15 000 ft
.
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (15 000/1 000) = -900 ft.
The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of
­­­­­15 900 ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
300 ft
. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 15 900 ft + 300 ft =
16 200 ft

RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze
.
Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze
(they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

Mid Latitude Depression development
1. CYCLOGENESIS STAGE
– this is known as the initial stage of the cyclone’s life cycle. In this stage, a boundary separates opposing fronts of cold and warm air. When an upper level disturbance moves over the front, it causes a wave to form.
Cyclonic shear begins to happen when the warm and cold fronts slide against each other => which generates the spinning motion characteristic of cyclones
.
2. DEVELOPED/MATURE STAGE
– during this stage, the wave formed during the initial phase grows as warm air replaces the space left behind by moving the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front, intensifying the cyclonic circulation.

- In the mid-latitude cyclone’s third stage,
the denser cold front catches up with the warm front

An
anticyclone
is a region of relatively high pressure. Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Due to this subsiding air, there are very few clouds within the high pressure core, but anticyclones can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath.

RADIATION FOG
. Caused by
radiation of the earth’s heat
at night, and the
conductive cooling below dew point of the air
in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly occurring in autumn and winter.
The
cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it
(which is not touching the ground), causing a very low-level inversion, known as
a ground inversion
.
Inversions are very stable areas
, and these ones in particular create radiation fog when the cold air inside the inversion drops below its dewpoint
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM
Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground.
High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog.
Calm or very light wind – any heavier wind (above 8 kt) causes turbulent mixing of the lower air, breaking up the ground inversion, and lifting the fog into low stratus cloud.
Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a much better heat conductor than sea surface.
To go through the options:
""In the inversion layer there is a lot of turbulence, which causes the formation of fog.""
There is very little turbulence in an inversion layer.
""The decrease of temperature with the height close to the surface is abnormally high.""
In a ground inversion, the air above the ground increases with height until the top of the inversion is reached, which is the opposite of this option.
""The air cools down close to the ground, without any convection.

An aircraft is approaching an airfield when the pilots notice that the headwind is becoming increasingly a crosswind from the right less than 2 000 ft above the airfield.

Near the surface, friction reduces the wind speed. This reduction will reduce the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force. The latter is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars towards the lower pressure. This wind is called surface wind.
In the Southern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle - towards the LOW - and, therefore,
be deflected to the right

Which condition is icing most likely to occur on a wing?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Thin wing, fast speed, large SCWD.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Thick wing, slow speed, large SCWD.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Thin wing, slow speed, small SCWD.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Thick wing, fast speed, small SCWD.'}]","Thin wing, fast speed, large SCWD.","Refer to figures.
Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of
large water droplets
that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Wings that are thin or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.
=>
Therefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer42247""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=C52D75C3-3DEE-4EF9-82AA-CA23A3D8E19C&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/C52D75C3-3DEE-4EF9-82AA-CA23A3D8E19C"" alt=""thumb_940_336_Screenshot 2020-10-01 at 09.19.56.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer42248""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=C3FA7163-675B-453B-AD2F-2A0177F6420D&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/C3FA7163-675B-453B-AD2F-2A0177F6420D"" alt=""thumb_80_383_Screenshot 2020-10-01 at 09.20.03.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",81214,"s.

AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR
Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it.
It detects drops of precipitation (such as rain/snow/hail)
. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.
A knowledge of the radar principle is paramount in order to accurately tune this system and interpret the weather radar display correctly.
Reflectivity
Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity).
The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. For example, a water particle is five times more reflective than an ice particle of the same size.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31275""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=4F12DB18-5DCD-4BAA-A776-30745EBE59B4&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/4F12DB18-5DCD-4BAA-A776-30745EBE59B4"" alt=""thumb_393_507384.jpg"" /> </a> </div></div>",72191,".

An altimeter indicates 1 500 ft with a pressure setting of 1 010 hPa set in the subscale. The pilot then changes the altimeter subscale setting to the regional pressure setting of 992 hPa.

A
Microburst
is a localized column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm. These also move outwards by reaction from the ground. The windshear (headwind to tailwind) may be between 50 and 90 kt.
Microbursts are short-lived, usually lasting less than 5 minutes, and they are relatively compact, usually affecting an area of 1 to 4 km in diameter.
Flying through a Microburst
1. Imagine you're approaching a microburst at 80 knots. As you enter the vortex ring, you experience turbulence and a rapid increase in airspeed as you pick up a headwind. You start to climb as your performance increases.
2. As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft.
3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease.
4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed. You're at a high angle-of-attack, and still descending.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a broad zone of air mass sometimes called the heat equator.
Here,
the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide
. Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere.
As the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth’s midsection. these convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear.
The air mass then flows outwards (both North and South), and
finally subsides in the subtropical high pressure zones (between 30° - 40°N)
, also called the
""horse latitudes"",
where the air moves downward toward Earth’s surface, forming a
high pressure surface region with clear, warm weather
.
The subtropical highs then cause the trade winds
, completing the cycle within the Hadley cell of the atmosphere.
Storms within the ITCZ will often go as high as 50 - 60 000 ft, so cannot be escaped upwards by commercial jet aircraft, and must be avoided using lateral deviations.
For this question then,
the convergence of the trade winds greatly affects the location and formation of the ITCZ
.
The location of the subtropical high pressure zones
have a large effect also, as
they are the source regions for the trade winds
(and also where the air ends up in the cycle of the Hadley cell).
The Easterly jet stream, also known as the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), is a significant feature in the tropical regions, especially during the summer months. It is characterized by strong easterly winds, blowing from east to west. The presence of the Easterly jet stream plays a crucial role in the formation and organization of the ITCZ.

In flight airframe icing occurs when an aircraft flies through icing conditions.
Icing conditions are mostly present within clouds below freezing temperature (0ºC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a ""supercooled"" state, in that their temperature is less than 0ºC, but they are still liquid. We call them
Supercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs).
When an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze,
adhering to the airframe in the process
. This can form icing such as
rime ice, clear ice, or mixed ice (a mixture of the two).
This can occur in precipitation also
, particularly when the air temperature or airframe is below 0ºC, where rain, freezing rain, or wet snow can adhere to the airframe or engines.
In reality, the best option here is ""dry snow"",
as dry snow is considered to be made up of
solid ice crystals only

dry snow is very unlikely to adhere to the wing, unlike the other options.

"An aircraft is cleared to climb to FL060 after take-off from an airport. The pilot levels off at FL060, but forgets to reset the altimeter. Local QNH 999 hPa remains set. What is the difference between the aircraft and other traffic at FL060? The aircraft is...

It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 999 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic.
To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to 1013 hPa (

What is the downside of airborne WX radar?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Severe weather can hide more severe weather behind it.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'It uses a lot of electrical power which in turn increases fuel consumption.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Weather radar is very harmful for humans and animals during cruise flight.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Echoes from the radar cannot be properly picked up in CAT.'}]",Severe weather can hide more severe weather behind it.,"Refer to figure.
This question refers to a phenomenon called:
WEATHER ATTENUATION
The weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a ""shadowing"" effect occurs.
The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,
Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.
Tip for avoiding shadows:
To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.
If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.
If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer37600""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=51F131E8-4E0B-4ABC-B769-98880D6837CC&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/51F131E8-4E0B-4ABC-B769-98880D6837CC"" alt=""thumb_341_266_Screenshot 2020-11-05 at 16.27.04.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",66359,".

TROPICAL REVOLVING STORMS (TRS). Are thermal depressions that develop over warm tropical oceans (wind speeds in excess of 33 kts). When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas.
Tropical revolving storms only form in certain conditions:
Must be within 5 and 25 latitude (Below 5º, Coriolis force is too small, above 25º latitude the sea is usually too cold)
Ocean temperatures must be greater than 26°C. The higher the ocean temperature the greater the pressure drop within the core =>

An explicit hazard of icing caused by freezing rain on the aerofoil of an aircraft is the..,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'formation of a very thin layer of icing mixed with rain that can remain unnoticed.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'accretion of ice on the elevator due to the slipstream from the flaps.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'potential accretion of ice aft of the ice-protection equipment.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'ailerons freezing at the outer ends of the wing.'}]",potential accretion of ice aft of the ice-protection equipment.,"Refer to figure.
Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice.
Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process.
This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.
The fact that the supercooled drops spread back before freezing is especially dangerous because there is the risk of accretion of ice aft of the ice-protection equipment.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31932""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=E5713FDE-F67E-47AC-996A-D1281C7BA082&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/E5713FDE-F67E-47AC-996A-D1281C7BA082"" alt=""thumb_243_140_Screenshot 2020-10-01 at 09.19.56.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer54587""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=d29740bd-26f7-4890-8a78-86697fd7fbf4&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/d29740bd-26f7-4890-8a78-86697fd7fbf4"" alt=""thumb_202304271528_clear-ice-aft-of-boot.jpg"" /> </a> </div></div>",72564,".

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of
large water droplets
that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Wings that are thin or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.

An observer is on the ground. What weather can he expect in the middle of a cold air drop?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Fair weather CU.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'TS/RA.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Clear skies.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Gusty winds.'}]",TS/RA.,"Refer to figure.
COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool, often referred to as Cold Air Drop, is a
low pressure system
, that only exists in the upper troposphere - it’s a
cooler-than-normal pocket of air
in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential.
This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold air pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.

The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected

This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation. The altimeter is set to the local QNH of 1023, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
12 000 ft
.
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation. The altimeter is set to the local QNH of 1023, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA +10ºC

What feature is normally associated with the initial stage of a thunderstorm?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Roll cloud'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Frequent lightning'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Continuous updraft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Rain or hail at the surface'}]",Continuous updraft,"Refer to figure.
A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage.
CUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE
Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air
Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.
The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.
=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.
MATURE STAGE
As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.
The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.
Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)
As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.
It can last up to 30 min
=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).
DISSIPATING STAGE
As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.
=> Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31714""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=7DA1C2E6-4082-4622-AB96-4F0FA2A2EC63&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/7DA1C2E6-4082-4622-AB96-4F0FA2A2EC63"" alt=""thumb_995_899_Screenshot 2020-10-09 at 13.56.12.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72272,".
A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage.
CUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE
Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air
Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.
The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.
=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.

MOUNTAIN/LEE WAVES develop on the lee, or downwind, side of mountains.
The most severe turbulence associated with Mountain waves can occur in the Rotor Zone
, lying beneath the crests of lee waves - often marked by Rotor/roll clouds. The most powerful rotor lies beneath the first wave crest (one wavelength downwind)
These waves are generated when:
Wind direction: generally perpendicular (+/-30º) fashion, raised up over the mountains. And no significant change in direction with altitude.
Wind speed: strong. At least 20 kt, increasing with altitude, at the summits.
Marked layer of stability/strong inversion around altitude of summits – which will work as a barrier over the mountains.
Cloud Formation associated with Mountain Waves
Lenticular clouds (lens shaped clouds) can form in the crest of the mountain waves.

MOUNTAIN/LEE WAVES develop on the lee, or downwind, side of mountains.
The most severe turbulence associated with Mountain waves can occur in the Rotor Zone
, lying beneath the crests of lee waves - often marked by Rotor/roll clouds. The most powerful rotor lies beneath the first wave crest (one wavelength downwind)
These waves are generated when:
Wind direction: generally perpendicular (+/-30º) fashion, raised up over the mountains. And no significant change in direction with altitude.
Wind speed: strong. At least 20 kt, increasing with altitude, at the summits.
Marked layer of stability/strong inversion around altitude of summits – which will work as a barrier over the mountains.
Cloud Formation associated with Mountain Waves
Lenticular clouds (lens shaped clouds) can form in the crest of the mountain waves.
Rotor/Roll Clouds can also occur in the rotors below the waves.
Cap clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes.

GLOBAL CIRCULATION PATTERN
At any time there are many weather systems weaving around the globe - which vary from year to year. However, when averaged over many years a global pattern of air movement emerges.
The reason we have different weather patterns is all because of the global atmospheric circulation caused by the rotation of the Earth and the amount of heat different parts of the globe receive.
The sun is our main source of heat, and because of the tilt of the Earth, its curvature, our atmosphere, clouds and polar ice and snow, different parts of the world heat up differently. The change in angle leads to stronger insolation on the Northern Hemisphere from April to September, and stronger insolation on the Southern Hemisphere from October to March. Thus, different pressure areas which trigger a large circulation between the equator and the poles are formed. Because of the Earth´s rotation, a direct flow between anticyclone (equator) and depression (poles) is prevented.

Refer to figure.
A squall line is a
narrow band of active thunderstorms
that normally contains very severe weather. Although it often forms 50 to 200 miles ahead of a fast-moving
cold front
, the existence of a front is not necessary for a squall line to form.
Obviously, with so many thunderstorms,
the weather around a squall line can be very bad
. This includes widespread turbulence, of course moderate to severe inside the clouds themselves, but also
some intense clear air turbulence (CAT) around, above, and underneath the squall line.
Squall lines should be avoided by an even larger margin than isolated CBs.
As for the other answers:
In a cold occlusion, there is usually turbulence within the clouds and precipitation, but not always clear air turbulence around (it very much depends on the altitude you fly through it, and the conditions of the day), whereas squall lines always contain many CBs so definitely do provide some CAT.
A warm high would be a stable portion of air, so unlikely to provide much turbulence at all.
With calm winds (no sea breeze, etc), a coastline could cause some turbulence due to changing thermals between land and sea, but it wouldn't usually be much, and certainly not as much as around a squall line.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer55774""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=ffad5c37-a243-415a-9788-eccdd2951ebe&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/ffad5c37-a243-415a-9788-eccdd2951ebe"" alt=""thumb_202307031333_squall-line.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",96589,"Note: This question is not exact, and we have had varying feedback about the options present in the exam.

FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope
– because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst
on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.

Orography has a great effect on air flows and formation of low pressure areas. When a flow of air meets a mountain range at a large angle, there is a marked tendency for much of the air to flow around the end of the range instead of flowing over the top.

HUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.
Humidity Measurement
Absolute Humidity
Refers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3
Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)
Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.
Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)
The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.
Expressed as g/kg of dry air.
Relative Humidity (RH)
The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.
Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.
RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100
RH 100% = Saturation
Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature.
In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.
From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.
Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand,
since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases
(provided that moisture content remains unchanged).","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31852""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=93632933-4079-4F4E-9FA1-FA3302C2E374&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/93632933-4079-4F4E-9FA1-FA3302C2E374"" alt=""thumb_271_Relative humidity.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73175,".

What is the prevailing wind direction over the East of India during the Summer?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Northerly'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Southerly'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Easterly'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Westerly'}]",Southerly,"Refer to figures.
During the Summer months
(June, July, August), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) follows the Sun Northwards away from the Equator. As a result, the
SE trade winds
originating from the Southern Hemisphere undergo a change in direction as they cross the geographic Equator and enter the Northern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right slightly in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become the South-Westerly monsoons. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.
In the context of
India
, the SW monsoon brings humid maritime air from the Indian Ocean. It hits the West coast of India directly, but does still affect the Eastern edge of India, as
the heat of the Indian landmass effectively ""pulls in"" the air from the Bay of Bengal to the East

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter
– December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south.
Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air
. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer
– June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon.
This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture
, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon).

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter
– December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south.
Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air
. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer
– June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon.
This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture
, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm."

The GEOSTROPHIC WIND blows parallel to straight and equidistant isobars.
1. Wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF), from high to low pressure.
2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be
deflected to the right
of its path in the
Northern Hemisphere
, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF.
3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces).
GEOSTROPHIC WIND:

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 979 hPa = 34 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 34 ft x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­1 020 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 1 020 ft =
3 980 ft
.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA
-21.8ºC
.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -21.8ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 980 ft - 1 600 ft = 2 318 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-21.8) × (2 380/1000) =
-207 ft
.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of
3 773 ft
.
Therefore, the height above ground = 3 773 ft - 2 320 ft =
1 453 ft
(1470 ft is the closest option).
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×

If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

RVR is a special measure of visibility in the direction of the runway

This is almost always
higher than the prevailing visibility
, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers).

What type of icing reduces visibility through an unheated windshield the most?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Clear Ice.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Rime Ice.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Ice crystal icing.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'All icing improves visibility.'}]",Rime Ice.,"Refer to figure.
There are a few different types of ice that can form on an aircraft in flight. The two most common are rime ice and clear ice.
RIME ICE
Rime ice is an
opaque, cloudy type of ice
build up that
usually
accretes on leading edges, such as the aircraft nose, wing/tail leading edges, etc. It is opaque due to the air trapped inside the ice;
this makes it very difficult to see through.
It is normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
CLEAR ICE
As you can expect from the name, clear ice is a transparent, layered form of icing, which usually runs backwards over the airframe or the wing. It is more dangerous than rime ice as it affects the aerodynamic shape of the wing more, and allows a larger ice build up, which adds weight and drag. It can also run backwards over control surfaces, freezing them in place.
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC.

There are a few different types of ice that can form on an aircraft in flight. The two most common are rime ice and clear ice.
RIME ICE
Rime ice is an
opaque, cloudy type of ice
build up that
usually
accretes on leading edges, such as the aircraft nose, wing/tail leading edges, etc. It is opaque due to the air trapped inside the ice;
this makes it very difficult to see through.
It is normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
CLEAR ICE
As you can expect from the name, clear ice is a transparent, layered form of icing, which usually runs backwards over the airframe or the wing. It is more dangerous than rime ice as it affects the aerodynamic shape of the wing more, and allows a larger ice build up, which adds weight and drag. It can also run backwards over control surfaces, freezing them in place.
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice would be much easier to see through if accreted on a windshield than the cloudy rime ice.
The other types of icing that can be encountered in flight are mixed ice (a mixture of rime and clear ice) and ice crystal icing (a much rarer formation inside engines and pitot tubes from tiny ice crystals above large storms - looks like rain on a heated windshield - bounces off unheated surfaces)"
A well-developed inversion exists in a valley. Which of the following describes a flight hazard and may influence the performance of an aircraft departing from an airfield on the floor of the valley?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Air flow in a vertical direction along the upwind side of the valley.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Orographic uplift in the afternoon forming cumuliform clouds above the inversion with associated vertical wind shear.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Strong winds above the inversion layer of up to 30 knots to 50 knots.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Anabatic winds blowing downhill due to the temperature inversion.'}]",Strong winds above the inversion layer of up to 30 knots to 50 knots.,"Refer to figures.
VALLEY INVERSIONS
form as a result of both cooling of the ground due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds
. They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that
below an inversion, the wind speed will be light
and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong
=>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the
stronger winds above.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. The fluctuation in airspeed can induce a stall precariously close to the ground.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31908""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=F57E34A9-7D08-4910-9C5D-7834EC711E6E&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/F57E34A9-7D08-4910-9C5D-7834EC711E6E"" alt=""thumb_84_503290.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31909""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=4D254B76-0939-4CDC-9CE0-FACCDF5D0B46&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/4D254B76-0939-4CDC-9CE0-FACCDF5D0B46"" alt=""thumb_688_836_Low_Level_Inversion.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72830,"s.

Assume that an aircraft is flying in the northern hemisphere at the 500 hPa pressure surface on a heading of 270 degrees.

It is important to realise how pressure systems act in the different hemispheres.
Northern Hemisphere:
High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a
clockwise
direction.
Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an
anti-clockwise
direction.
If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your

Southern Hemisphere is the other way around:
High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in an

Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in a

Freezing Rain
occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice. Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the cold airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process.

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM/DEPRESSION. Is an area which has a lower air pressure than the surroundings (the value of the isobars increase with distance from the centre). Isobars are closely spaced together.
In a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude.
If the air is initially humid, this general lifting, in the centre of a depression, leads to condensation and formation of
clouds. If the air is unstable, CB clouds may form. Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers,
Weather associated with Low Pressure Systems:
- CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause
- PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression.

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM/DEPRESSION. Is an area which has a lower air pressure than the surroundings (the value of the isobars increase with distance from the centre). Isobars are closely spaced together.
In a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude.
If the air is initially humid, this general lifting, in the centre of a depression, leads to condensation and formation of
clouds. If the air is unstable, CB clouds may form. Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers,
Weather associated with Low Pressure Systems:
- CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause
- PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression.
- VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air
- TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air
- WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind."
"An aircraft maintains a constant indicated altitude of 5 500 ft from A (1 050 ft AMSL - QNH 968 hPa) to B (650 ft AMSL - QNH 1016 hPa).Assuming that the altimeter subscale setting remains unchanged at 968 hPa, the height of the aircraft above the surface at B are:

"An aircraft is expected to clear a terrain by 2000 ft. The elevation of the mountain is 6254 ft and the local QNH at an airport of elevation 3100 ft is 991 hPa, ISA +24ºC. Calculate the flight level in order to clear the mountain range by the specified clearance.

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 8 254 ft
(6 254 + 2 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA +24ºC
. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 254 ft - 3 100 ft =
5 154 ft
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (+24) × (5 154/1000) =
495
ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
subtracted from
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­7 759 ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa =
22 hPa
. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
660 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 7 759 ft + 660 ft =
8 419 ft
.
As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 8 419 ft, which is
FL85
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

During the summer months
(June, July, August), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) tends to shift away from the Equator and move further northward. As a result, the
SE trade winds
originating from the Southern Hemisphere undergo a change in direction as they cross the geographic Equator and enter the Northern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become
SW monsoons
. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In the context of
India
, these SW monsoons bring humid maritime air.
Conversely,
during the winter months
(December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the NE trade winds from the Northern Hemisphere need to cross the geographic Equator to reach the ITCZ. Upon entering the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects these winds to the left, resulting in a change in their direction from NE to NW. Consequently, the Southern Hemisphere experiences NW monsoons, particularly in southern parts of Africa, while the Northern Hemisphere encounters NE monsoons in regions that previously experienced SW monsoons during the summer months (such as parts of Africa and India).

What is the reason for the seasonal movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'The yearly change of the monsoon winds.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Radiation from the Earth`s surface.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Changes of the daylight hours.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'The yearly movement of Earth around the Sun.'}]",The yearly movement of Earth around the Sun.,"The
ITCZ
follows the Sun in
that the position varies seasonally.
This is because the ITCZ is the culmination of the hottest places in the world for a particular latitude, the
""thermal equator""
as it is often known, and this moves with the Sun a lot. It moves
North
in the Northern Hemisphere
Summer
and
South
in the Northern Hemisphere
Winter
.
Therefore, the ITCZ is responsible for the wet and dry seasons in the
tropics
.
The sun crosses the equator twice a year in
March and September
, and
consequently
makes for
two wet seasons
each year.
In December and July,
when the sun is at its greatest extent north or south of the equator makes for
two dry seasons.
Further
away from the equator
, the two wet seasons merge into one, and the climate becomes more
monsoonal
, with
one wet season
and
one dry season.
In the Northern Hemisphere the wet season occurs from
May to July,
in the Southern Hemisphere from
November to February
.
As the ITCZ moves due to the seasons, it is therefore based on the Earth's position in orbit of the Sun.
Note: The ITCZ is subject to
large
seasonal movement

ITCZ
follows the Sun in
that the position varies seasonally.

North
in the Northern Hemisphere
Summer
and
South
in the Northern Hemisphere
Winter

Therefore, the ITCZ is responsible for the wet and dry seasons in the
tropics

The sun crosses the equator twice a year in

consequently
makes for
two wet seasons
each year.
In December and July,
when the sun is at its greatest extent north or south of the equator makes for
two dry seasons.

one wet season

one dry season.
In the Northern Hemisphere the wet season occurs from

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC.
However,
you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC
. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

"You are flying from Manchester to Dublin and the highest obstruction is 3 860 ft.Given the following meteorological report from a nearby aerodrome at 36 ft AMSL, determine the lowest safe flight level giving 2 000 ft terrain separation:QNH: 972 hPa  Temperature: -2°C  Assume 30 ft per 1 hPa","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'FL50'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'FL60'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'FL70'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'FL75'}]",FL75,"Refer to figure.
Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 5 860 ft
(3 860 + 2 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude of 36 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-2ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -
17ºC.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -17ºC
. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 5 860 ft - 36 ft = 5 824 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-17) × (5 824/1000) =
-396
ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added to
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­
6 256 ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 972 hPa = 41 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 41 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 1 230 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 6 256 ft + 1 230 ft =
7 486
ft
.
The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is
FL75
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

Let's break down the components of the statement:
(1)
Convergence
: Convergence refers to the coming together or convergence of air masses. In the context of a trough, it indicates that air is flowing toward the trough axis from different directions and meeting at that point.
(2)
Lifting
: Lifting refers to the upward movement of air. In the presence of convergence, the air is forced to rise along the trough axis. This lifting motion can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation.
(3)
Cumuliform clouds or squalls
: Cumuliform clouds are large, puffy clouds with a vertical development, often associated with convection. Squalls are intense, localized storms characterized by strong winds and heavy precipitation. Along the line of the trough, the convergence and lifting can result in the formation of cumuliform clouds or trigger squall-like weather conditions.

GEOSTROPHIC WIND vs GRADIENT WIND
The
Geostrophic wind

The
Gradient wind
occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces:
PGF
CF
Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation)
GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW
The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind.
PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force
GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH
The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level.
Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.
With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.
Stratosphere
=
The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere
, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground.
With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.
This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.
The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the
tropopause;
the upper boundary is called the stratopause.
The
ozone layer
or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.
It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.
T
he ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere
, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically.
In case of this specific question:
Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature here increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere.
Cold air is more dense than warm air.
If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable
,
and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom.
Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate):
Absolute stability
: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up.ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m).

Absolute instability

Conditional instability
: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR.
ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude).

In this particular case, the jet is blowing from north to south. Therefore, applying the rule of thumb, when looking downstream the cold air will be on our left and, therefore,
on the east of the jet core.

Ozone is a gas that is naturally present in our atmosphere. Each ozone molecule contains three atoms of oxygen and is denoted chemically as O
3
. Ozone is found primarily in two regions of the atmosphere. About 10% of atmospheric ozone is in the troposphere, the region closest to Earth (from the surface up to about 10–16 kilometres). The remaining ozone (about 90%) resides in the
stratosphere between the top of the troposphere and about 50 kilometres altitude
.
The large amount of ozone in the stratosphere is often referred to as the “ozone layer.”
The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, it is also toxic to humans. This means that the ozone concentration at
jet cruising levels
can be enough to be

In which environment is aircraft structural ice most likely to have the highest rate of accretion?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Snow.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Cirrus clouds.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Stratus clouds.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Freezing rain.'}]",Freezing rain.,"Refer to figure.
Freezing Rain can cause significant accumulations
of clear ice.
Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing
. The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Clear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice.
Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C.
""Snow"" INCORRECT. Snow is solid precipitation in the form of ice crystals. Remember that for airframe icing to form water must be present in liquid state.
""Cirrus Clouds"" INCORRECT.
You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31911""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=50FC4D19-CCD9-4304-91C2-145332B79322&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/50FC4D19-CCD9-4304-91C2-145332B79322"" alt=""thumb_557_140_Screenshot 2020-10-01 at 09.19.56.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72160,".

POLAR FRONT DEPRESSIONS
.
These move eastwards
along the semi stationary front “Polar front” which is located between 35ºN and 65ºN (higher latitudes in Summer, lower in Winter).
An air mass is simply a large portion of air in the Earth's atmosphere, defined by
where it has been ""formed""
(a high pressure, stable source region where it develops its initial characteristics) and
the track it has taken
to get somewhere. For Western Europe, the air masses are classified as
T(Tropical), P(Polar) and A(Arctic)
- in terms of their thermal qualities - and
c(continental) or m(maritime)
- in terms of their water content. Note that Artic air is from directly North of Europe, whereas Polar air is from the Polar cell fo the atmosphere, so source regions like Siberia or Northern Canada/Greenland.
The Polar front splits Sub-tropical air (which we refer to as Tropical for European air masses) from Polar air. Therefore, when a Polar front depression forms (in the North Atlantic specifically), the warm sector to the South of the depression is that Tropical air, whereas the rest of the depression is surrounded by the Polar air. Therefore, in this question;
(1) is
Tropical
air in the warm sector,

(4) is a little more complicated. It is the air North of the depression. From the options, we have already narrowed down the correct answer, and that states that the air North of the depression ""may be""

when Artic air can easily flow down from the North Pole. Often, for a new depression, this air would also be Polar, but later down the life cycle, it can drag Artic air down to it. Also, the question says

Refer to figure.
A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – Initial/Developing stage, Mature stage and Dissipating stage.
INITIAL/DEVELOPING STAGE
Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air
Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.
The cloud will reach the mature stage in about 15-20 minutes.
=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts. The cloud is a
towering cumulus
during this stage
MATURE STAGE
As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.
The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.
Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)
As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.
It can last up to 30 minutes (in a single cell).
=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).
DISSIPATING STAGE
As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.

Nonetheless, the answer should be the same, as the scenario is almost exactly the same. Please let us know if you see these in the exam, and anything you can remember about the question(s) that you see, thank you!
If an indication of a temperature inversion is given as part of an ATIS, it means that it is quite a noticeable inversion.
Inversions occur when the air gets warmer with increased altitude
, so when warmer air is above colder air. This can happen for many reasons, due to night cooling, valley inversions, frontal activity, etc.
An inversion is incredibly stable, meaning that there is very little vertical movement of air through the inversion. This means that
little to no mixing occurs
, and therefore, the wind velocity (speed and direction) below the inversion may be totally different from the wind velocity above the inversion, and the difference may happen over a very small band of altitude.
This means that flying through an inversion has the potential for quite significant vertical wind shear (changing wind velocity with changing altitude).
This is why information about them are passed to pilots, so they can expect the wind shear and make decisions based on it.
Inversions can also have large effects on aircraft performance, and the aircraft performance will be better below the inversion in the colder air.
To look at the options:
""The possibility for a sudden reduction in visibility due to the blowing snow.""
The ATIS made no mention of snow.
""A sudden degradation of braking performance on the runway.""
The ATIS said nothing about a wet or contaminated runway, braking performance might be perfectly fine. The low air temperature has the opportunity to form ice from any moisture, but if the ground if dry then the traction should not be much less than normal.

Pressure patterns in the atmosphere dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, in a low pressure area, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force.
The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means
that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force.
This makes it
very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving
. There is, however,
some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone
, and
some air which enters a low pressure zone
. This
mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more
.
The outflow of air from a high is called divergence
. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days.
The inflow of air into a low is called convergence
. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather.

the atmospheric divergence, assumably from a high pressure zone

"The decrease in temperature, per 100 meters, in a saturated rising parcel of air at lower level of the atmosphere is approximately:","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '0.6°C'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '1°C'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '0.35°C'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '1.5°C'}]",0.6°C,"The temperature lapse rate of air is the amount of temperature change the air experiences over a difference in height. There are a different lapse rates, depending on the situation.
This question is simply asking about the SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate)
DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate)
- This is the amount of temperature that dry (non-saturated) air changes by
if it rises or sinks in the atmosphere
. Adiabatic means that no external temperatures affect it, and any parcel of dry air will conform to this DALR if moved up or down. The DALR is -3ºC/1000ft, meaning that for every 1 000 ft gained, a dry parcel of air will reduce in temperature by 3ºC. This happens because air rises into lower pressure, therefore expanding and making the molecules further apart, so less collisions occur and less heat is present.
SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate)
- This is the same concept as for the DALR, but has an added layer of complication. When saturated (Relative Humidity 100%) air rises, it will become cooler (as is standard due to expansion), but that means that
the air can no longer hold as much water, so some water is released as condensation
, turning into liquid water droplets. This process is going from a high energy state (water vapour) to a lower energy state (liquid), meaning that
latent heat is released
(see annex above).
The release of latent heat
adds temperature to the air
, which gains back a little of the 3ºC lost per 1 000 ft (DALR). This means that
saturated air does not lose heat as quickly with altitude as dry air does
, but by how much depends on the heat of the air (and therefore the water content. More water to condense means that more energy is put into the atmosphere, so the air cools less, so
the wetter air cools slower with altitude increase
).
For standard temperatures we say that the SALR is about
-1.8ºC/1000ft
, meaning that the water condensation releases 1.8ºC into the atmosphere every 1 000 ft.
Sometimes lapse rates are measured in degrees (ºC) per 100 m, in which case, the DALR would be -1ºC/100m and
the SALR would be -0.6ºC/100m on average
(remember, the SALR can change).
ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate)
- This is the
ACTUAL
change in temperature throughout the atmosphere, measured by a radiosonde. The ELR decides whether pockets of air that moves upwards or downwards will be unstable or stable, as the ELR dictates what the moving air will have to compare its temperature to (read up on stability for more explanation).",,73200,"The temperature lapse rate of air is the amount of temperature change the air experiences over a difference in height. There are a different lapse rates, depending on the situation.
This question is simply asking about the SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate)
DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate)
- This is the amount of temperature that dry (non-saturated) air changes by
if it rises or sinks in the atmosphere
. Adiabatic means that no external temperatures affect it, and any parcel of dry air will conform to this DALR if moved up or down. The DALR is -3ºC/1000ft, meaning that for every 1 000 ft gained, a dry parcel of air will reduce in temperature by 3ºC. This happens because air rises into lower pressure, therefore expanding and making the molecules further apart, so less collisions occur and less heat is present.
SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate)
- This is the same concept as for the DALR, but has an added layer of complication. When saturated (Relative Humidity 100%) air rises, it will become cooler (as is standard due to expansion), but that means that
the air can no longer hold as much water, so some water is released as condensation
, turning into liquid water droplets. This process is going from a high energy state (water vapour) to a lower energy state (liquid), meaning that
latent heat is released
(see annex above).
The release of latent heat
adds temperature to the air
, which gains back a little of the 3ºC lost per 1 000 ft (DALR). This means that
saturated air does not lose heat as quickly with altitude as dry air does
, but by how much depends on the heat of the air (and therefore the water content. More water to condense means that more energy is put into the atmosphere, so the air cools less, so
the wetter air cools slower with altitude increase
).
For standard temperatures we say that the SALR is about
-1.8ºC/1000ft
, meaning that the water condensation releases 1.8ºC into the atmosphere every 1 000 ft.
Sometimes lapse rates are measured in degrees (ºC) per 100 m, in which case, the DALR would be -1ºC/100m and

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold air pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold air pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31888""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=3565C1CF-301F-4D0C-89E7-C3B9D79DDB8B&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/3565C1CF-301F-4D0C-89E7-C3B9D79DDB8B"" alt=""thumb_780_32_509454.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72044,".

According to the METAR, the conditions at the aerodrome are: very light wind and no significant cloud (NSC). The air temperature is the same as dew point 06/06 (wich means 100 % Relative humidty). Fog is reported.
The above described conditions, favour the formation of
Radiation fog.
RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs
at night and early morning
and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes).
It is typically onlu up to a maximum of 500 ft thick
.
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM
LITTLE CLOUDS OR CLEAR SKY - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground.
HIGH RELATIVE HUMIDITY - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation.
CALM OR VERY LIGHT WIND – which will result in rapid cooling.
SURFACE -

According to the METAR, the conditions at the aerodrome are: very light wind and no significant cloud (NSC). The air temperature is the same as dew point 06/06 (wich means 100 % Relative humidty). Fog is reported.
The above described conditions, favour the formation of
Radiation fog.
RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs
at night and early morning
and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes).
It is typically onlu up to a maximum of 500 ft thick
.
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM
LITTLE CLOUDS OR CLEAR SKY - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground.
HIGH RELATIVE HUMIDITY - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation.
CALM OR VERY LIGHT WIND – which will result in rapid cooling.
SURFACE -
only occurs over land

ADVECTION FOG. Is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion
. The surface can be land or sea

but the speeds of around 15 kts provide the conditions for maximum vertical development of advection fog.
COLD SURFACE
. Colder than the dew point of the air moving over it – to ensure condensation.
HUMID AIR.
High relative humidity – so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent condensation.

The weather behind a cold front is typically:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Cu.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Cb.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'St.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Cs.'}]",Cu.,"Refer to figure.
COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.
A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.
Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns.
- Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation.
- An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.

RIDGES
A ridge is
an outcrop of relatively high pressure
(the opposite of a trough), that brings the same weather as a high pressure system (anticyclonic weather).
Within anticyclonic weather, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Due to this subsiding air, there are
very few clouds within the high pressure area
, but high pressure can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath.

RIDGES
A ridge is
an outcrop of relatively high pressure
(the opposite of a trough), that brings the same weather as a high pressure system (anticyclonic weather).
Within anticyclonic weather, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Due to this subsiding air, there are
very few clouds within the high pressure area
, but high pressure can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath. CBs can form due to thermal uplift in the afternoon, but this is made more difficult by the subsiding air. Ridges actually can move and change shape faster than a standard anticyclone, whilst having almost the same weather, so they are

A typical phenomenon created by valleys and mountain slopes is called:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Valley inversion.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Advection fog.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Mountain obstruction.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Valley winds.'}]",Valley inversion.,"Refer to figure.
VALLEY INVERSIONS
form as a result of both cooling of the ground due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal
down-slope
winds
. They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.
How does a Valley Inversion form?
The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.
Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.
Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer39306""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=4C80BA73-50F8-45D1-8501-7C64088FFBA3&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/4C80BA73-50F8-45D1-8501-7C64088FFBA3"" alt=""thumb_66_282_503290.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",78371,".

In a constant pressure environment, the amount of water vapor, measured in grams per kilogram of dry air, known as the saturated mixing ratio, exhibits a relationship with temperature. As the temperature rises, the saturated mixing ratio increases, while it decreases with a reduction in temperature.
During the day, as the temperature increases, the relative humidity (RH) tends to decrease. This is because
warmer air has a higher capacity to hold moisture
, allowing it to accommodate a larger amount of water vapor.
However, as the day progresses and reaches around 1500 hrs, the temperature starts to decrease. As the temperature drops, the air's capacity to hold water vapor also decreases. This leads to an increase in the relative humidity during the evening and night hours. The higher relative humidity at night is particularly significant during autumn and winter when mist and fog tend to form after dark.
The rising RH during the night is a result of the reduced temperature and the limited ability of the air to hold water vapor.

HILL/OROGRAPHIC FOG. Usually stratiform cloud (ST, SC) whose base is lower than the summit of the hills.
Formed when humid stable air is forced to ascend along the side of a mountain or hill
or by the normal turbulence action producing ST and SC.
Formed during the day or night.
As the air rises, it cools adiabatically => condensation level is reached, and a cloud is formed.
Hill fog requires a wind up the slopes of a mountain (anabatic wind) and is promoted by high humidity. The hill fog quickly disappears if the wind changes (e.g.
katabatic flow/downslope wind
)

=> this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations).
Isohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed) ,then we can assume a low pressure.
Having that established, it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts.

COLD-AIR DROP
/COLD POOL
A cold-air drop is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposphere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
They are formed when
cold air aloft breaks away from the polar region,
making its way South (in the Northern Hemisphere), past the
Polar front.
They are not linked to mountains, so that option is not correct. The other options are easy to discount.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -
They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks.

Foehn-effects in mountainous areas occur..,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'on the lee-side of the mountain range when precipitation is falling on the upwind side of the mountain range.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'when a dry and warm wind blows on the upwind side of the mountain range.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'when orographic cloud forms over the mountain range.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'any time when a strong airflow exists perpendicular to the orientation of the mountain range.'}]",on the lee-side of the mountain range when precipitation is falling on the upwind side of the mountain range.,"Refer to figure.
FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes
of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and
precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes.
By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31753""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=3481D3F5-E9D5-4EC0-A40A-4B26A2DB0836&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/3481D3F5-E9D5-4EC0-A40A-4B26A2DB0836"" alt=""thumb_692_Foehn_EFFECT.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73370,".

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze
.
Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds
or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

WARM FRONT. Warm air replacing cold air.
The warm air is forced to rise over the cold air

Conditions associated with a cold front:
Surface winds
: A change in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of any front.
Before the front arrives,
winds ahead of the front (in the colder air mass)
are typically from the South/South-West, but once the front passes through, winds usually
veer
around, and come from the West/South-West
(in the warmer air mass).
The wind veering actually tells us nothing, as all standard Northern Hemisphere fronts cause the wind to veer.
Temperature
: steady before the front. An increase is usually observed at the front. Behind the warm front, it is steady again.
Pressure
:
As the front approaches, the pressure gradually decreases
. Then once the front passes,
the pressure should remain constant, at the lowest pressure value
(whilst within the warm sector).
Clouds
: As a warm front approaches, the clouds can be expected to begin at high levels about 500 nm ahead of the front, gradually reducing to the ground as the front passes. In stable air, you can expect Cs, Ci, As, Ns, St and some frontal fog.
In unstable air, the rising warm air can trigger convective activity, such as Cu or
Cb
, with a good chance of the
CBs being embedded in the surrounding clouds
(as mentioned in this question).
Precipitation
: Heavy rain can be expected ahead of the front. Thunderstorms can occur if the airmass is unstable. The rain tends to turn into drizzle as the front passes.
Visibility
:
Generally poor, due to the potential for fog and drizzle
, but this can vary quite a lot depending on the air masses involved.

Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory.
This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.

The main effects of a lightning strike are:

Mixed clouds are composed of both supercooled water droplets and ice crystals. Most precipitation from these clouds starts out as:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Drizzle.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Snow.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Rain.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Hail.'}]",Snow.,"Refer to figure.
BERGERON PROCESS
Describes the process of precipitation formation in the middle and high latitudes. Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water.
Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds
. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface.
Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow.

Two unsaturated volumes of air at different temperatures mix.

CLOUD FORMATION
Cloud is formed by air being lifted and cooled adiabatically until the water vapour condenses out as water droplets.
In other words, when the invisible water vapour in the air condenses into visible water droplets or ice crystals. For this to happen,
the parcel of air must be saturated
=> unable to hold all the water it contains in vapour form, so it starts to condense into a liquid or solid form. The height at which this occurs is called the condensation level - it is also the height of the cloud base. The condensation level is the height at which the rising air, cooling adiabatically, has cooled to the dew point temperature. Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the formation of cloud.
There are two ways by which saturation is reached.
(a) By increasing the water content in the air, e.g. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more.
(b) By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation occurs, and is unable to 'hold' any more water.

A
cold air drop
or cold air pool is a low-pressure system typically found in the upper troposphere, representing a region of colder-than-normal air at higher altitudes within the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air ascends through the atmosphere, it cools as it rises but remains relatively warmer compared to the surrounding cold pool. This temperature contrast encourages the rising air to continue its ascent, fostering increased cloud formation and the potential for rain or thunderstorms. Cold pools aloft are frequently associated with deep atmospheric instability, often leading to severe weather conditions.

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze
.
Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large supercooled water droplets that are found in cumuliform clouds
or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.

Relative Humidity (RH)
The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.
Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.
RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100
RH 100% = Saturation
As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature.
In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.
From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.
Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too.
As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases.
On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.
Now, with regards to this question, if the parcel of air is forced to descend it will become compressed and hence heat up, by the adiabatic process =>

"During the life cycle of a thunderstorm, which stage is characterized predominantly by downdrafts?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Mature stage'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Tornado stage'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Initial stage'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Dissipating stage'}]",Dissipating stage,"Refer to figure.
A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage.
CUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE
Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air
Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.
The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.
=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.
MATURE STAGE
As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.
The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.
Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)
As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.
It can last up to 30 min
=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).
DISSIPATING STAGE
As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.

Firstly, it is important to point out that this is a Contour chart and pressure information is not provided - Pressure is constant everywhere
=> this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level, in ISA conditions, corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations).
Isohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed) ,then we can assume a low pressure.
Having that established, it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts.
The closer the contours the stronger the wind.
Circulation of air around a High and Low Pressure system:
In the Northern Hemisphere:
- The air moves anticlockwise around a low pressure centr
e; and
- Clockwise around a high pressure centre.

- The air moves clockwise around a low pressure centre; and
- Anticlockwise around a high pressure centre.

COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts.
The front moves at right angles to itself at a
speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full)
measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.
A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts.
The front moves at right angles to itself at a
speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full)
measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.
A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.
Note: The warm front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to
2/3
of the geostrophic interval measured along the front."

The Rocky Mountains, also known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. Mountain-wave turbulence in the presence of directional wind shear over the Rocky Mountains in Colorado is a common weather phenomenon observed.
MOUNTAIN WAVES are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier. The most intense turbulence is usually located at low-levels, leeward of the mountains in or near the rotor cloud, if present.
Mountain waves coming off the Rocky Mountains can exist at altitudes higher than most jets can fly - Often extends from the surface to slightly above the tropopause.

How does a Valley Inversion form?
The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.
Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.

The duration of the cumulus stage (building stage) of a single-cell TS is:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '15 - 20 min'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '30 - 40 min'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '40 - 50 min'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '60 min'}]",15 - 20 min,"Refer to figure.
A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage.
CUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE
Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air
Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.
The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.
=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.
MATURE STAGE
As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.
The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.
Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)
As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.
It can last up to 30 min
=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).
DISSIPATING STAGE
As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher
and the surface chart may show high pressure.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer28586""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=9A45AA9C-8D0A-41AD-A098-56CDD8CCF9A4&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/9A45AA9C-8D0A-41AD-A098-56CDD8CCF9A4"" alt=""thumb_464_501249.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72045,".

An
anticyclone
is a region of relatively
high pressure.
Usually, the isobars of an anticyclone are more
widely spaced
than with depressions, and anticyclones move much slower, and can sometimes sit for weeks in a single location (called a blocking anticyclone).
There are five types of anticyclone:
warm
,
cold
,
temporary cold, ridges
and
blocking
.
Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air
converging
, then descent of air within the anticyclone (
subsidence
) and
divergence
at the surface. Due to this subsiding air, there are very few clouds within the high pressure core, but anticyclones can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath. CBs can form due to thermal uplift in the afternoon, but this is made more difficult by the subsiding air.

It involves supercooled water droplets and explains how ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid cloud droplets within a mixed cloud.  There are more water molecules surrounding the water droplets than there are surrounding the ice crystals.
This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature

COLD AIR DROP
A cold air drop (cold pool) is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold air drops (cold pools) are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks.

But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days."

"What intensity and type of airframe icing is most likely to occur when an aircraft descends rapidly from FL320 (OAT -45 °C) to FL60 in warm, moist clear air?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Light opaque rime and light clear ice.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Light or moderate hoar frost.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Nil ice.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Moderate opaque rime.'}]",Light or moderate hoar frost.,"Refer to figure.
HOAR FROST
It occurs when a sub-zero surface comes into contact with moist air (the ambient temperature is lowered to saturation level). It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air.
Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating).
This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles).
Hoar frost can occur:
on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.
in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases:
If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer.
If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion.
The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31509""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=A5297889-F5F2-48F4-9B51-25AEA46C2E0A&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/A5297889-F5F2-48F4-9B51-25AEA46C2E0A"" alt=""thumb_603_Screenshot 2020-11-05 at 17.56.15.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73396,".

"Which of the following options is the best recommendation to avoid dangerous icing for a pilot of an aircraft, in temperate latitudes, if the planned route of the flight would take the aircraft along a warm front on the cold-air side?
Consider the following additional information; the ceiling of the Nimbostratus clouds is at 1400 ft AGL, the freezing level on the cold-air side is at 1000 ft AGL, on the warm-air side at 2000 ft. The front is quite weak and the width of the precipitation band is 20 NM. The aircraft is equipped with serviceable anti-icing and de-icing systems. The pilot does NOT have a valid instrument rating, therefore the flight has to be made in VMC.","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Fly on the cold-air side of the front just below the altitude of the freezing level of the air on the warm side.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': ""Stay at least 5 NM ahead of the front clear of the clouds and don't cross the front.""}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Traverse the warm front perpendicular to its direction of movement and fly below the freezing level.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Fly below the clouds and above the freezing level on the cold-air side because any precipitation encountered in this area will NOT adhere to the airframe.'}]",Traverse the warm front perpendicular to its direction of movement and fly below the freezing level.,"Refer to figure.
The most dangerous part of a warm front is the potential for a ""rain-ice triangle"" to form. That is where the warm sector air above the frontal surface precipitates raindrops that are warmer than 0°C, into an area that is colder than 0°C. If an aircraft is within that cold sector, then the airframe will be below freezing temperature, and the droplets will be around 0°C, which will then freeze upon hitting the airframe, causing one of the most dangerous types of ice accumulation, rain-ice.
Rain-ice builds up incredibly quickly on all parts of the upper surface of the wing, not just the leading edge, meaning that
standard anti-ice and de-icing systems are only partially effective, and often completely overpowered by the ice accretion.
As warm fronts are very shallow, rain ice triangles are very wide but not usually very tall, in this case only 1000 ft.
This means that the best way to avoid them is to fly above or beneath the region in which they can occur.
Also, it is best to fly
perpendicular to the front
(therefore
parallel to its direction of movement
), so the rain-ice triangle danger can be passed through as quickly as possible, rather than staying near it for unnecessarily long. Unfortunately,
this is not possible as there will most likely be clouds in the warm sector at the level that is being flown
(the pilot is VMC only), and
the pilot has to traverse the warm sector
anyway within the cold sector to reach their destination.
In the case of this pilot who is licensed for VMC flight only, they cannot climb into the NS clouds above, and should instead
remain under 1000 ft (the freezing level in the cold sector)
to remain out of the rain-ice triangle. It is useful to note that there is a chance of ice pellets at this altitude, as the raindrops may have frozen on their descent.

The air in the inversion layer between 1900 ft and 2300 ft is very much warmer than the air between the bottom of the inversion and the airfield at 1416 ft.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>

The air in the inversion layer between 1900 ft and 2300 ft is very much warmer than the air between the bottom of the inversion and the airfield at 1416 ft.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion.

COLD-AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold-air drop is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with
deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible
.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 977 hPa = 36 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 36 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
1 080 ft
. This value needs to be
subtracted
from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude
= 5 000 ft - 1 080 ft =
3 920
ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude 1 600 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of
ISA approx. -22ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 920 ft - 1 600 ft =
2 320 ft
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (2 320/1000) = -
204 ft
.
The temperature correction is
subtracted
from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 920 ft - 204 ft =
­­­­­3 716 ft
.
Meaning that our clearance from the obstacle is 3 716 - 2 320 =
1 396 ft ⇒
closest answer 1 420 ft
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×
Indicated alt/1000
=
___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 977 hPa = 36 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 36 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
1 080 ft
. This value needs to be
subtracted
from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude
= 5 000 ft - 1 080 ft =
3 920
ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude 1 600 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of
ISA approx. -22ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 920 ft - 1 600 ft =
2 320 ft
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (2 320/1000) = -
204 ft
.
The temperature correction is
subtracted
from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 920 ft - 204 ft =
­­­­­3 716 ft
.
Meaning that our clearance from the obstacle is 3 716 - 2 320 =
1 396 ft ⇒
closest answer 1 420 ft
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV

Cold temperature corrections exist because barometric altimeters are calibrated for ISA conditions, and when the air column is colder than ISA, the pressure drops faster with altitude, and the altimeter will over-read. This over-reading makes the pilot think they are higher than they actually are, so reduces terrain clearance.

additions
to the altitudes we fly

Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
ISA Deviation from 15ºC to -10ºC is
ISA - 25ºC
The indicated altitude for the correction is from sea level to 3 500 ft.

350 ft
The corrected Decision Altitude is 3500 + 350 =
3850 ft",,96609,"This question is far simpler than it looks. An airport at sea level has an approach with a DA of 3 500 ft (way higher than usual due to the terrain), and must be temperature corrected when the OAT is below -5ºC; the current OAT is -10ºC, calculate the corrected DA.
Cold temperature corrections exist because barometric altimeters are calibrated for ISA conditions, and when the air column is colder than ISA, the pressure drops faster with altitude, and the altimeter will over-read. This over-reading makes the pilot think they are higher than they actually are, so reduces terrain clearance.
This means that cold temperature corrections are
additions
to the altitudes we fly
, so we know we are actually at the intended true altitude, even with an over-reading altimeter.

Which one of the following local winds is a Foehn wind?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Bora'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Chinook'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Harmattan'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Sirocco'}]",Chinook,"Refer to figures.
FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes
of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
=>
One such wind is the Chinook which blows on the eastern side of the Rocky mountains in Canada - usually blows during the winter months and produces a rapid and considerable rise in temperature.
How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer28604""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=E4FC1DE9-A30B-4725-BCA3-C3AABB95E061&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/E4FC1DE9-A30B-4725-BCA3-C3AABB95E061"" alt=""thumb_485_509090.2.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31755""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=293A8986-2E6A-4FB1-885F-840D9D0E79D0&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/293A8986-2E6A-4FB1-885F-840D9D0E79D0"" alt=""thumb_717_Foehn_EFFECT.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",72086,"s.

To start, we need to know the flight level (pressure altitude), and then the expected ISA temperature calculated to check the temperature in the option.
Calculator Trick
This is more of a rule of thumb, you go down and across the calculator as shown in the annex above, and the numbers of the buttons are the hundreds of hectopascals, then you count up from 1 to 5, and those are the hundreds of flight levels.
For instance, 700 hPa is approximately FL100, 500 hPa is FL 180 (which is close to FL200, a discrepancy of this method), 300 hPa is approximately FL300, etc.
Note: 200 hPa actually equates to FL390, and 100 hPa equates to FL510, to be a little more precise. The others are very close, remembering the 500hPa = FL180.
We can then use this method to calculate the flight level, and use the formula:
ISA temp. = 15 - 2 (pressure altitude in thousands of feet)
Also, remember that the ISA temperature reduces by 2ºC down to -56.6ºC, where it then becomes isothermal, so all altitudes above approx. 36 000 ft have an ISA temp of -56.5ºC, up to about 60 000 ft.
Using these methods,
At 700 hPa, the ISA temperature is -5ºC.
At 500 hPa, the ISA temperature is -21ºC.
At 200 hPa, the ISA temperature is -56.5ºC. (the ISA temperature does not drop below this value)

A cold-air drop is a mass of cold polar air which becomes separated from the other polar air by transiting towards the warmer air in the subtropical region.
This can take a few different forms, but the most usual form is that the air between 10-30,000ft is much colder in one patch (sometimes called a cold-air pool), than the sub-tropical air around it. This cold air means that the column of air in that region is much shorter than around it, as
pressure drops off more quickly with increasing height in a cold air mass
.
The cold air becomes trapped
, and usually forms a circle on a chart.
This does form a
low pressure zone high in the troposphere
, which can be seen on medium and high level pressure charts. It also forms a region where there is a

A cold-air drop is a mass of cold polar air which becomes separated from the other polar air by transiting towards the warmer air in the subtropical region.
This can take a few different forms, but the most usual form is that the air between 10-30,000ft is much colder in one patch (sometimes called a cold-air pool), than the sub-tropical air around it. This cold air means that the column of air in that region is much shorter than around it, as
pressure drops off more quickly with increasing height in a cold air mass
.
The cold air becomes trapped
, and usually forms a circle on a chart.
This does form a
low pressure zone high in the troposphere
, which can be seen on medium and high level pressure charts. It also forms a region where there is a
huge amount of cold air sat on top of warm (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere
. This means that there is a
very high environmental lapse rate

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.

Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC.

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
10 600 ft
(8 600 ft + 2 000 ft).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -9ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature

In this case, the temperature correction is
added
to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­

Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa =
18 hPa
. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 18 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =
486 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 10 982 ft + 486 ft =
11 468 ft

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
10 600 ft
(8 600 ft + 2 000 ft).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -9ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-9) × (10 600/1000) =
-382 ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added
to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­
10 98
2
ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa =
18 hPa
. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 18 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =
486 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 10 982 ft + 486 ft =
11 468 ft
.
According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies an
westbound magnetic track VFR flight
. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is:
FL125
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (

FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes
of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR.
Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes.
By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.

Learning Objective 050.09.01.04.03: Identify weather situations and their relevant areas where high concentrations of ice crystals are likely to occur.
Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in
high altitude
due to high concentration of very small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (
often referred to as ""sublimation"" in meteorology
).
Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected
.
Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions
. Research has shown that
strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes
where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
These areas are perfect places for ICI to occur,
in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes.
Therefore, we can keep a good lookout for such clouds using our onboard weather radar, which readily picks up cumulonimbus clouds due to their large water content.
Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.
This question calls them oceanic mesoscale convective systems, which simply means that the storms are full of moisture from the sea below, and are at least medium in size. Smaller convective systems would not be powerful enough to cause significant ice crystal icing. See the annex above for a visual representation of where HIWC (High Ice Water Content) can be found.
These very small ice crystals are

Learning Objective 050.09.01.04.03: Identify weather situations and their relevant areas where high concentrations of ice crystals are likely to occur.
Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in
high altitude
due to high concentration of very small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (
often referred to as ""sublimation"" in meteorology
).
Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected
.
Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions
. Research has shown that
strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes
where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
These areas are perfect places for ICI to occur,
in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes.
Therefore, we can keep a good lookout for such clouds using our onboard weather radar, which readily picks up cumulonimbus clouds due to their large water content.
Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.
This question calls them oceanic mesoscale convective systems, which simply means that the storms are full of moisture from the sea below, and are at least medium in size. Smaller convective systems would not be powerful enough to cause significant ice crystal icing. See the annex above for a visual representation of where HIWC (High Ice Water Content) can be found.
These very small ice crystals are
not found in cirrus clouds
. The ice crystals which make up cirrus clouds are much larger, and actually less dangerous to fly through, especially as they can be easily seen."
Which weather phenomena are typical for the northern side of the Alps with strong winds from the south (Foehn)?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Decrease in temperature, moderate to severe icing.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Icing, huge mass of clouds.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Good visibility, turbulence.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Continuous precipitation, severe turbulence.'}]","Good visibility, turbulence.","Refer to figure.
FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst
on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.
With regards to this question
, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds.

"On a clear night, a Cargolux 777 freighter takes-off from King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A short time after lift-off, climb performance is significantly worsened. What is the probable reason?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'A severe downdraft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'An extremely low relative humidity'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'A strong temperature inversion'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Contamination such as sand and dust reducing engine performance'}]",A strong temperature inversion,"Refer to figure.
On a night of clear skies with calm or light surface wind, a temperature inversion can form due to surface cooling -
which can lead to windshear
.
Temperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude.
Strong inversions are known to happen in desert areas, such as Saudi Arabia, where the surface will heat up quickly during the day and cool off rapidly at night.
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above
.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion.
- Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind =>
which causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in Rate of Climb
. The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground.
- Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,
the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines

True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 983 = 30 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 30 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­900 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude

Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (9 100/1000) = -546 ft.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­

To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

QNH: The atmospheric pressure adjusted to mean sea-level.
If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter’s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above mean sea level.
QFE: The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level).
If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet.
QNE: The indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013,25 is set in the altimeter’s subscale.
In other words, it is the pressure altitude at the landing runway threshold.
QFF: Mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions.
So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature.
If the airfield is at MSL => QFE, QNH and QFF will all be the same pressure
. The temperature could be more or less than +15ºC and the pressure could be more or less than 1013.2hPa; it doesn't have to be ISA conditions. Let's now see why:
QFE is the pressure value at the airfield;
QNH is a QFE value which has been brought to MSL using ISA conditions;

QNH: The atmospheric pressure adjusted to mean sea-level.
If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter’s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above mean sea level.
QFE: The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level).
If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet.
QNE: The indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013,25 is set in the altimeter’s subscale.
In other words, it is the pressure altitude at the landing runway threshold.
QFF: Mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions.
So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature.
If the airfield is at MSL => QFE, QNH and QFF will all be the same pressure
. The temperature could be more or less than +15ºC and the pressure could be more or less than 1013.2hPa; it doesn't have to be ISA conditions. Let's now see why:
QFE is the pressure value at the airfield;
QNH is a QFE value which has been brought to MSL using ISA conditions;
If you were to use actual conditions, QFF would be obtained instead.
Imagine that you are in an airfield at MSL, you measure QFE and obtain i.e. 1020 hPa
Now, reduce it to MSL with standard conditions to obtain QNH. You are already at MSL, the value is the same.

A cold pool, often referred to as Cold Air Drop, is a
low pressure system
, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a
cooler-than-normal pocket of air
in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential.

"Given the following information and assuming no instrument errors, what is the approximate true height of the aircraft above airport elevation?OAT: ISA -15° C  Pressure altitude: 3300 ft  Indicated height: 3300 ft (with the airport QFE set in the altimeter subscale)","[{'id': 1, 'answer': '3390 ft'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '3102 ft'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '3490 ft'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '3022 ft'}]",3102 ft,"Learning Objective 050.01.06.03.06: Determine the true altitude/height for a given altitude/height and a given ISA temperature deviation.
There are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots:
True Altitude - The actual altitude above msl (mean sea level).
Indicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure.
Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels.
It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True.
In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question they have given us a
Pressure Altitude of 3 300 ft
, and also an
Indicated
Height
of 3300 ft
. Not only does that tell us that the
QNH is the same as standard pressure setting (1013 hPa)
, but it also tells us that our
QFE is also the same pressure, and therefore our airport is at sea level
. This has the very nice effect of making
height and altitude interchangeable.
This simplifies the question into a temperature correction only, from Indicated Altitude to True Altitude.
TEMPERATURE CORRECTION
A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA.
==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude.
==>
When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.
As this scenario has an OAT of 15ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. (There are a couple of different ways to calculate this, but they all use the same formula with shifted decimal places).
Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude
*
[in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA)
So for this calculation,
Temp. Correction = 4 x 3.3 x 15 =
198 ft
True Altitude is less than Indicated Altitude, so
True Altitude (and also True Height) = 3 300 - 198 =
3 102 ft
*
Indicated Altitude between the aircraft and the point at which the pressure is measured, but in this scenario, that is sea level, so Indicated Altitude works. For example, if the pressure had been measured at 1 000ft, then the number 2.3 (thousands of feet) would be used instead of 3.3.",,83093,"Learning Objective 050.01.06.03.06: Determine the true altitude/height for a given altitude/height and a given ISA temperature deviation.

Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels.
It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True.
In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question they have given us a
Pressure Altitude of 3 300 ft
, and also an
Indicated
Height
of 3300 ft
. Not only does that tell us that the
QNH is the same as standard pressure setting (1013 hPa)
, but it also tells us that our
QFE is also the same pressure, and therefore our airport is at sea level
. This has the very nice effect of making
height and altitude interchangeable.
This simplifies the question into a temperature correction only, from Indicated Altitude to True Altitude.
TEMPERATURE CORRECTION
A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA.
==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude.
==>
When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.
As this scenario has an OAT of 15ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. (There are a couple of different ways to calculate this, but they all use the same formula with shifted decimal places).
Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude
*
[in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA)
So for this calculation,
Temp. Correction = 4 x 3.3 x 15 =
198 ft
True Altitude is less than Indicated Altitude, so
True Altitude (and also True Height) = 3 300 - 198 =
3 102 ft
*
Indicated Altitude between the aircraft and the point at which the pressure is measured, but in this scenario, that is sea level, so Indicated Altitude works. For example, if the pressure had been measured at 1 000ft, then the number 2.3 (thousands of feet) would be used instead of 3.3."

Learning Objective 050.04.01.03.02: Explain the influence of an inversion on the formation of stratus clouds.
In the troposphere,
inversions cause an incredibly stable layer of atmosphere,
which reduces the upwards motion of cumuliform clouds,
and limits the vertical extent of stratiform clouds completely.
Stratiform clouds can form for many reasons, such as turbulence in the air causing mixing, orographic or frontal uplift, etc., but they always occur in a stable layer of atmosphere. When the air gets pushed up or mixed up enough to reach its dewpoint, the cloud base forms, and if the air is raised above this, then the cloud continues upwards as high as the air is pushed/mixed.
An inversion, however, is much too stable, and any air moving into the inversion will either fall back out of the layer, as the layer is a lot warmer than the air below (preventing mixing of the air), or just warm up above the dewpoint and stop forming cloud. This means
that stratiform clouds remain below an inversion

Moisture content and type of precipitation are the main factors of visibility during precipitation. For instance, rain has relatively good visibility, as the light is scattered a little through each raindrop, but they are relatively see through still. More importantly,
rain is a very dense form of precipitation
, as so there are less raindrops than for a snow shower of the same moisture content

This is absolutely correct
, snow flakes give worse visibility than rain. Large snowflakes are worse still, as they block more light.
B) ""Visibility in a shower with blowing snow is better than in heavy rain.""
Blowing snow is where the wind picks up the snow from the ground and the snow which falls during a snow shower, creating very low visibility indeed, as low as 1 metre visibility. Heavy rain is not as bad as this, so this is incorrect.
C) ""Visibility in heavy snow is better than in drizzle with small water droplets.""

050.09.01.04.05: Explain how a pilot may possibly avoid areas with a high concentration of ice crystals.
Ice crystal icing
(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in
high altitude
due to high concentration of very small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (
often referred to as ""sublimation"" in meteorology
).
Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected
.
Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions
. Research has shown that
strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes
where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.
The best way to avoid ICI is laterally, by travelling more than the standard 20 nm away from the regions of high convective activity, and if possible, reducing the risk even further by travelling upwind of the area, so that the wind does not blow ice crystals into the path of the aircraft.
This question asks further about whether to be above and below the tropopause to avoid the majority of the ice crystals. This is a little more difficult, as ice crystal icing events have occurred both above and below the tropopause in the past. It does look like most of the HIWC (High Ice Water Content - responsible for ICI) exists below the tropopause for the majority of storms, and those CBs that break through the tropopause do not seem to spread out the ice crystals very far from the cloud. See the annex for a visual representation of this.
For this reason,
an aircraft should remain above the tropopause to best avoid Ice Crystal Icing

is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates obscure the clarity of the sky. Haze is primarily caused by particles in the atmosphere which scatter the sunlight.
The increase in airborne particulates combined with specific (low) sun angles causes the slant range visibility to be reduced even further.
Worst cases occur around sunrise during the summer months –  time of day where haze-reduced visibility may be exacerbated by the low sun angle.

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC.
However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.
Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kts, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas.
Tropical revolving storms only form in certain conditions:
Must be within 5 and 25 latitude

RADIATION FOG

cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it

Mountain Waves =
oscillations to the lee side (downwind) of high ground resulting from the disturbance in the horizontal air flow caused by the high ground.
Mountain waves are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere.
Mountain waves may also be referred to as standing waves or lee waves. These are likely to form when the following
atmospheric conditions are present
:
Wind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band.
Wind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 20 knots, increasing with height.
A marked layer of stability around the altitude of the summits, e.g. an isothermal layer or inversion, with less stable air above and below
If the wave amplitude is large enough, then the waves become unstable and break, similar to the breaking waves seen in the surf. Within these 'breaking waves', the atmospheric flow becomes turbulent. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 4,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors
to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.
Provided there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds are formed with mountain waves and these provide useful warning of the presence of such waves. The clouds are:
Lenticular, or lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind. They may be found up to, and possibly above, the tropopause.
Rotor, or roll-clouds occur under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind and will be level or slightly above the ridge crest.

COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart
and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks.

SUBSIDENCE is related to a HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM/ANTICYCLONE.
Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface
. Typical weather in an area under the influence of a High-Pressure is clear skies due to the sinking motion of air (subsidence)
, lighter winds than around a Depression and reduced chance of precipitation.

However, as that air parcel begins to move, it is deflected by the Coriolis force to the right in the northern hemisphere (to the left on the southern hemisphere). As the wind gains speed, the deflection increases until the Coriolis force equals the pressure gradient force. At this point, the wind will be blowing parallel to the isobars. When this happens, the wind is referred to as

The true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground. Thus, the actual wind would equal the geostrophic wind only if there were no friction and the isobars were perfectly straight.

LIGHTNING is a huge electrical discharge that flows between clouds, from a cloud to air, or from a cloud to the ground. It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10°C and -10°C.
Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail.
This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage
(a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.

To start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn
pressure altitude
into
indicated altitude.
The QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 =
31 hPa
less
than standard pressure. Because we are in
low pressure
, our indicated altitude is
lower
than our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 =
930 ft
lower than the pressure altitude.
Indicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 =
28,070 ft
To make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate.
ISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43⁰C, but our OAT is 17⁰C colder than this at -60⁰C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17⁰C.
As our
temperature is lower than ISA
, our true altitude will be even
lower

Stratosphere
= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.
Mesosphere

FOEHN EFFECT
Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes
of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.
- How does it form?
When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upwind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus,
the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent

This will cause a drift of air from over the land to over the sea at about 1000 ft. The drift of air will cause the surface pressure over the land to fall, and the surface pressure over the sea to rise. As a result there will be a flow of air

On average, sea breezes extend 8 to 14 NM either side of the coast and the speed is about
10 kt

Land breezes
From mid-afternoon the land is starting to cool and this process will accelerate after sunset. Overnight the situation will reverse and pressure will now be higher on land than over the sea as the temperature reduces. This will give rise to a wind now blowing

A Polar Maritime air flow moves south over the UK. What cloud type would you expect?,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Altocumulus.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Nimbostratus.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Cumulus.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Stratus.'}]",Cumulus.,"Refer to figures.
Polar maritime (mPc) is the most common air mass to affect the British Isles. Cold, moist, NW airflow.
This air mass is characterised by frequent showers at any time of the year. On approaching the UK,
the warmer ground causes the air mass to warm from below, becoming unstable
. This gives rise to
Cumulus and Cumulonimbus
, heavy showers (sometimes hail and thunderstorms). Visibility is good (except in showers). At night inland the cloud dissipates, the clearing skies causing a low level inversion with stable air below - ideal conditions for radiation fog.

Polar maritime (mPc) is the most common air mass to affect the British Isles. Cold, moist, NW airflow.
This air mass is characterised by frequent showers at any time of the year. On approaching the UK,
the warmer ground causes the air mass to warm from below, becoming unstable
. This gives rise to
Cumulus and Cumulonimbus
, heavy showers (sometimes hail and thunderstorms). Visibility is good (except in showers). At night inland the cloud dissipates, the clearing skies causing a low level inversion with stable air below - ideal conditions for radiation fog.
If an air mass flows from cold to warmer regions, it will be heated from underneath, which makes it unstable
. Therefore, polar and arctic air masses become unstable, whereas tropical air masses become more stable when travelling to colder areas.

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter
– December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south.
Winds blow from the winter Siberian high
–
bringing cool and dry continental air.
The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer
– June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon.
This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture
, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud.

For the same horizontal distance between adjacent isobars the gradient wind speed will be the least at:,"[{'id': 1, 'answer': '30°N with anti-cyclonic circulation.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': '50°N with anti-cyclonic circulation.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': '30°N with a cyclonic circulation.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': '50°N with a cyclonic circulation.'}]",50°N with a cyclonic circulation.,"Refer to figure.
Learning Objective 050.02.02.01.07: Explain the gradient wind effect and indicate how the gradient wind differs from the geostrophic wind in cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation.
This question is made up of two parts, first we need to know which latitude the wind will be weakest at, and secondly we need to know whether high or low pressure zones (anti-cyclones or cyclones) have the lowest gradient wind speed.
To start, we have to understand how the (geostrophic) wind works.
1. Initially, wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF),
from high to low pressure
.
2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be
deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere
, and
to the left in the Southern Hemisphere
. If the Coriolis Force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF.
3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces).
The Coriolis Force is directly proportional to the speed of the wind
, so
when we have a high PGF, we need a high CF to oppose it, and the wind flows
faster.
The Coriolis Force also gets stronger away from the equator
, due to the changing distance from the Earth's rotational axis (barely any change around the equator, lots of change up at the poles). This means that, near the equator, air has to get a lot faster to work up enough Coriolis Force to oppose the PGF, meaning higher wind speeds.
Therefore, the further away from the equator (the higher the latitude), the slower the wind speeds
(for the same PGF, which is the isobar spacing)
Next, we must understand what the gradient wind is, and when it is strongest/weakest.
Previously, we have spoken about the geostrophic wind, which is the wind that flows along straight isobars. That is a rarity though, and more often, isobars are curved, meaning that the wind is turning. This introduces imbalanced forces, which cause this turning of the wind.
Note: There are a couple of different ways to reason and understand gradient winds, centrifugal force and centripetal force. Centrifugal force is not actually a force at all, it is the effect of inertia in a turn. Nonetheless, you may have learnt either of these two ways. We believe centripetal force is slightly easier to explain in text format, so we will do that.
If you wish to take the easy road here, remember that,
for the same isobar spacing (same PGF), gradient wind speed is
LOW around a LOW,
and
HIGH around a HIGH
.
This means the
wind is slower around a low pressure zone (cyclone)
and
faster around a high pressure zone (anticyclone)
. This should be sufficient for the vast majority of questions.
If you would like to gain a slightly higher level of understanding, continue reading.
The change of direction of the wind happens because of imbalanced forces, and the two main forces on the wind are Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and Coriolis Force. If either becomes larger than the other, then the wind will bend in that direction. This means that in a high pressure zone, for instance,
the PGF outwards is not as strong as the Coriolis Force inwards, as the wind is bending in the direction of the Coriolis Force
. To do this,
the wind has to go faster than usual
(usual being the geostrophic, straight line wind), to build up a higher Coriolis Force.
The opposite is happening around the low pressure zone.
The PGF is stronger than the Coriolis Force
, meaning that the resultant, or ""residual"", force is going inwards towards the low. This means that the Coriolis Force is weaker than usual, and therefore
the wind speed is less than the geostrophic wind.
This ""residual force"" is what we call centripetal force
, and is the force which causes rotation to occur. It is a force towards the centre of rotation, and without it, objects will just continue in the same direction. We need centripetal force to allow wind to bend around low and high pressure zones, and it comes from imbalanced PGF and Coriolis Force, which causes the
low around a low
and
high around a high
behaviour we have discussed.
Remember, the PGF stays the same, but the Coriolis Force changes due to the wind speed.
In conclusion then, to get the weakest wind speeds with the same isobar spacing, we need
a high latitude and a low pressure zone

Learning Objective 050.02.02.01.07: Explain the gradient wind effect and indicate how the gradient wind differs from the geostrophic wind in cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation.
This question is made up of two parts, first we need to know which latitude the wind will be weakest at, and secondly we need to know whether high or low pressure zones (anti-cyclones or cyclones) have the lowest gradient wind speed.
To start, we have to understand how the (geostrophic) wind works.
1. Initially, wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF),
from high to low pressure
.
2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be
deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere
, and
to the left in the Southern Hemisphere
. If the Coriolis Force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF.
3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces).
The Coriolis Force is directly proportional to the speed of the wind
, so
when we have a high PGF, we need a high CF to oppose it, and the wind flows
faster.
The Coriolis Force also gets stronger away from the equator
, due to the changing distance from the Earth's rotational axis (barely any change around the equator, lots of change up at the poles). This means that, near the equator, air has to get a lot faster to work up enough Coriolis Force to oppose the PGF, meaning higher wind speeds.
Therefore, the further away from the equator (the higher the latitude), the slower the wind speeds
(for the same PGF, which is the isobar spacing)
Next, we must understand what the gradient wind is, and when it is strongest/weakest.
Previously, we have spoken about the geostrophic wind, which is the wind that flows along straight isobars. That is a rarity though, and more often, isobars are curved, meaning that the wind is turning. This introduces imbalanced forces, which cause this turning of the wind.
Note: There are a couple of different ways to reason and understand gradient winds, centrifugal force and centripetal force. Centrifugal force is not actually a force at all, it is the effect of inertia in a turn. Nonetheless, you may have learnt either of these two ways. We believe centripetal force is slightly easier to explain in text format, so we will do that.
If you wish to take the easy road here, remember that,
for the same isobar spacing (same PGF), gradient wind speed is
LOW around a LOW,
and
HIGH around a HIGH
.
This means the
wind is slower around a low pressure zone (cyclone)
and
faster around a high pressure zone (anticyclone)
. This should be sufficient for the vast majority of questions.
If you would like to gain a slightly higher level of understanding, continue reading.
The change of direction of the wind happens because of imbalanced forces, and the two main forces on the wind are Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and Coriolis Force. If either becomes larger than the other, then the wind will bend in that direction. This means that in a high pressure zone, for instance,
the PGF outwards is not as strong as the Coriolis Force inwards, as the wind is bending in the direction of the Coriolis Force
. To do this,
the wind has to go faster than usual
(usual being the geostrophic, straight line wind), to build up a higher Coriolis Force.
The opposite is happening around the low pressure zone.
The PGF is stronger than the Coriolis Force
, meaning that the resultant, or ""residual"", force is going inwards towards the low. This means that the Coriolis Force is weaker than usual, and therefore
the wind speed is less than the geostrophic wind.
This ""residual force"" is what we call centripetal force
, and is the force which causes rotation to occur. It is a force towards the centre of rotation, and without it, objects will just continue in the same direction. We need centripetal force to allow wind to bend around low and high pressure zones, and it comes from imbalanced PGF and Coriolis Force, which causes the
low around a low
and
high around a high
behaviour we have discussed.
Remember, the PGF stays the same, but the Coriolis Force changes due to the wind speed.
In conclusion then, to get the weakest wind speeds with the same isobar spacing, we need
a high latitude and a low pressure zone
, so

The Maritime Tropical (mTw) is the most important moisture-bearing and rain-producing air mass throughout the year.
In winter it moves poleward and is cooled by the ground surface. Consequently, it is characterized by fog or low stratus or stratocumulus clouds, with drizzle and poor visibility.
In summer the characteristics of the mTw air mass over the oceans and in zones of cyclonic activity are basically the same as in winter.
Over warm continental areas, however, the air mass is strongly heated so that, instead of fog and low stratus clouds, widely scattered and locally heavy afternoon
thunderstorms occur.

THUNDERSTORM AVOIDANCE
Avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 NM => this general guideline applies even to jet fighters and large airliners.
Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud.
If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm.
Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts
Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft.
If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms.
You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM.
Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.
Furthermore, as discussed above, Airborne Weather radar detects large droplet precipitation and hail (present in CBs), it does not detect stratus/stratocumulus or very small water droplets => making it relatively easy to identify embedded cumulonimbus.

This leaves us with a fast-moving cold front and a slow-moving cold front. This is slightly counterintuitive, as one might think that a fast moving cold front is likely to be more ""aggressive"" than a slow-moving one, but it is actually the opposite.

The aircraft has been cruising above the transition layer, in reference to a flight level, so has had standard pressure setting (1013.2 hPa) set. This means that
the altimeter is indicating the pressure altitude of the aircraft

Structural Icing
It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.
There are 2 general types of structural icing:
RIME ICE
Normally encountered in
stratiform clouds
. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface.
It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.
CLEAR ICE
Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface).
Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds
(dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC.
Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.
Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:

An aircraft is flying at 3000 ft in a layer of strato-cumulus cloud and experiences light icing.This icing intensifies as the aircraft crosses a mountain barrier whilst still in the cloud.

It is known to produce moderate to severe icing conditions. Icing is greater over the ridges than over valleys and greater on the windward side than on the leeward side.
The lifting of the cold unstable by the mountains results in the formation of more-or-less continuous supercooled clouds. Also,
the orographically-induced updrafts permit the air to support larger cloud droplets than otherwise, so that the icing is more intense. Furthermore, dust from the mountain slopes induce ice accretion - due to the presence of freezing nucleus.
Freezing nucleus, any particle that, when present in a mass of supercooled water, will induce growth of an ice crystal about itself; most ice crystals in the atmosphere are thought to form on freezing nuclei.",,73429,"If flying around mountains, be extra cautious.

The lifting of the cold unstable by the mountains results in the formation of more-or-less continuous supercooled clouds. Also,
the orographically-induced updrafts permit the air to support larger cloud droplets than otherwise, so that the icing is more intense. Furthermore, dust from the mountain slopes induce ice accretion - due to the presence of freezing nucleus.
Freezing nucleus, any particle that, when present in a mass of supercooled water, will induce growth of an ice crystal about itself; most ice crystals in the atmosphere are thought to form on freezing nuclei."

"An aircraft is cleared to descend to 4 000 ft. During descent, the pilot forgets to reset the altimeter to local QNH 1 030 at the Transition Level.

Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1013 hPa is set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 4 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same altitude as the remaining traffic.
To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to the local QNH (

The Rocky Mountains, also known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. Mountain-wave turbulence in the presence of directional wind shear over the Rocky Mountains in Colorado is a common weather phenomenon observed.
MOUNTAIN WAVES are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier. The most intense turbulence is usually located at low-levels, leeward of the mountains in or near the rotor cloud, if present.
Mountain waves coming off the Rocky Mountains can exist at altitudes higher than most jets can fly - Often extends from the surface to slightly above the tropopause.

When the cold front catches up with the warm front, the warm sector is lifted.
WARM OCCLUSION:
the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air behind the cold front.
The cold air behind the cold front rises over colder air ahead of the warm front. The ""less cold"" air rises over the leading colder air. This forces the cold front aloft (It ""climbs up"" the back of the warm front).

As the pressure of 1043 hPa is
higher than the standard pressure setting

higher
than the pressure altitude.
This is also what allows the transition level to be a lower value than the transition altitude; FL45 is actually higher than 5000 ft on the QNH.

TORNADO is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction.
Characteristics:
Tornadoes are associated with Cumulonimbus and large Cumulus clouds.
The highest incidence is in the southern states of the USA (tornado alley) in the spring and early summer - very warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, moving north, meets relatively cold air coming from the northwest - which gives massive instability and the windshear required.
They can last from several seconds up to (roughly) 30 minutes - however, most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes

COLD FRONT. Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.
The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.
The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.
Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.
Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50 - 100 NM
(93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.
A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.

"An aircraft is expected to clear a terrain by 2000 ft. The height of the mountain is 4430 ft and the local QNH at an airport of elevation 2420 ft is 994 hPa, OAT +9ºC. Calculate the flight level in order to clear the mountain range by the specified clearance.
Use 1 hPa = 27 ft","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'FL70'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'FL60'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'FL75'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'FL50'}]",FL70,"Refer to figure.
Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
6 430 ft
(2 000 ft + 4 430 ft).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (2 420/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­+10ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+9ºC, which is an ISA deviation of
ISA -1ºC
.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -1ºC
. The airfield elevation must be taken into account for temperature correction: 6 430 ft - 2 420 ft = 4 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-1) × (4 010/1000) =
-16 ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added
to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
6 446
ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 994 hPa =
19 hPa
. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 19 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =
513 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 6 446 ft + 513 ft =
6 959 ft
.
As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 6 959 ft, which is
FL70
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×
Indicated alt/1000
=
___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at
6 430 ft
(2 000 ft + 4 430 ft).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (2 420/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­+10ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+9ºC, which is an ISA deviation of
ISA -1ºC
.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA -1ºC
. The airfield elevation must be taken into account for temperature correction: 6 430 ft - 2 420 ft = 4 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (-1) × (4 010/1000) =
-16 ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
added
to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
6 446
ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 994 hPa =
19 hPa
. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 19 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =
513 ft
. This value needs to be
added
to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 6 446 ft + 513 ft =
6 959 ft
.
As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 6 959 ft, which is
FL70
.
RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification:
Height correction for the temp = 4 × (
ISA DEV
) ×
Indicated alt/1000
=
___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

COLD-AIR DROP/COLD POOL
A cold-air drop is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart
and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -
They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

THUNDERSTORM AVOIDANCE
Avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 NM => this general guideline applies even to jet fighters and large airliners.
Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud.
If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm.
Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts
Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft.
If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms
. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM.
Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.

The term “adiabatic process” refers to the process of energy conversion in a volume of air without exchange of heat with the surroundings. We know that when a volume of a parcel of air changes the temperature changes. If the parcel of air is compressed, its temperature increases. If it is allowed to expand, its temperature decreases. This change of volume is most frequently caused by lifting the parcel of air or its subsidence. As a parcel of air is lifted to a higher level the pressure of its surrounding air decreases => the pressure inside this parcel of air is higher than its surrounding air => the parcel of air is allowed to expand => expansion results in lower temperature => parcel of air cools. This is the principle why temperature decreases with altitude. When parcel of air subsides (sinks) the opposite is true => it ""enters"" an area where the pressure of its surrounding air is higher => parcel of air is forced to compress => compression results in an increase of temperature.
Saturation occurs when the actual water vapor content of a given parcel of air reaches the maximum value that the parcel of air can hold at the given temperature. We know that the capacity of air to hold water vapor is determined by its temperature. If the temperature is lowered to the point where the maximum water vapor holding capacity is reached or if water vapor is added and reached this ""maximum capacity"" value saturation occurs. Saturation is equivalent of 100% Relative Humidity (ratio of the actual water vapor content to the maximum possible water content capacity of the air). Cooling of the air beyond saturation point results in condensation = transformation of water vapor into liquid water - water droplets. Saturation can be achieved:
by adding water vapor to the parcel of air and thus increasing the actual water vapor content,
by decreasing the temperature of the air parcel (adiabatic cooling = adiabatic expansion) and thus reducing its capability to hold water vapor,

Hence, if the QNH is low, the aircraft may encounter freezing rain at a lower altitude compared to a situation with a higher QNH."

With regards to this question
,
the mountain has a north-south orientation, with a westerly wind - the west side is the upwind side where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds and precipitation as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes.
The east side (where the aerodrome is located) is the leeward/downwind side
, where air descends and becomes
drier and warmer
(Foehn wind).
To conclude, on the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. Initially, the air warms at the SALR, since some moisture will be lost on the windward side, the warming of the descending air at SALR will be shorter - the air becomes unsaturated at a lower temperature (higher altitude) than the original dew point.

Clear Ice/Glaze Ice
If a large, supercooled water droplet strikes an aircraft, it will start to freeze and this will
release latent heat

water droplet flows back over the impact surface forming clear ice

The ice will easily modify and destroy the shape of the aerofoil and its weight can cause problems with control, especially if the build-up is uneven. It is illustrated in the figure above.

COLD AIR POOL
A cold air pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.
As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a ""cold pool aloft"" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.
CHARACTERISTICS
Cold air pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.
Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher.
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.
If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold air pools persists for approximately 3 days.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer32028""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=6AB2B33E-5DA9-4921-8E52-0A936C527153&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/6AB2B33E-5DA9-4921-8E52-0A936C527153"" alt=""thumb_953_780_32_509454.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",66449,".

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 4 237 ft
(2 852 + 385+ 1 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­36ºC, which is an ISA deviation of
ISA +21ºC
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA +21ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (+21) × (4 237/1 000) =
356
ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
subtracted from
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­3 881 ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1038 hPa - 1013 hPa =

. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:

= 25 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
750 ft
. This value needs to be
subtracted from
the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 3881 ft - 750 ft =
3 131 ft

As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 3 131 ft, which is
FL35

RULES.
The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:
The aircraft must fly at 4 237 ft
(2 852 + 385+ 1 000).
This
altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­36ºC, which is an ISA deviation of
ISA +21ºC
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is
ISA +21ºC
. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height
correction for temperature
= 4 × (+21) × (4 237/1 000) =
356
ft
.
In this case, the temperature correction is
subtracted from
the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of
­­3 881 ft
.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1038 hPa - 1013 hPa =
25 hPa
. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:
Pressure correction
= 25 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =
750 ft
. This value needs to be
subtracted from
the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 3881 ft - 750 ft =
3 131 ft
.
As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 3 131 ft, which is
FL35
.

On a night of clear skies
with calm or light surface wind, a
temperature inversion
can form due to surface cooling - which can lead to windshear.
Be prepared to encounter this situation when taking off or landing in calm wind under clear skies within a few hours before or after sunrise.
- How does it happen?
Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>
wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above.
This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion.
Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,
the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines

temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreased aircraft performance

Icing layers in stratus clouds with a vertical thickness in excess of 3000 feet are rare, so a change of altitude of a few thousand feet may take the aircraft out of icing -
This is, by far, better than selecting a new track due to its widespread in the horizontal.
This may be done by climbing above the ice forming zone or to descend and fly contact below the ice forming zone. The advisability of this course would depend on the ceiling and visibility along the route at the lower level concerned.
In this case, the stratiform cloud is at the minimum safe altitude => therefore, a climb to a higher level should be considered.

Troposphere
= The lowest layer of our atmosphere.It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level.Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.
Stratosphere
= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.
Mesosphere
= The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here.
Thermosphere
= The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km.The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees.

GEOSTROPHIC WIND vs GRADIENT WIND

The
Gradient wind

The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed.
Therefore, for the same isobar spacing,

“Severe CAT may be expected in the core of a jet stream.”
INCORRECT.
Jet streams
can be described as a core of strong winds (speeds >/= 60 kts) around 5 to 7 miles above the Earth’s surface, generally blowing from west to east. These occur as a result of strong horizontal temperature contrasts in the atmosphere.
There is a strong relationship between jet streams and clear air turbulence.
CAT is caused by the vertical and horizontal wind shear of jet streams. CAT is most severe on the cold side of the jet, next to and just underneath the axis of the jet and not in the core of the jet stream

TORNADO is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction.
Characteristics:
Tornadoes are associated with Cumulonimbus and large Cumulus clouds.
The highest incidence is in the southern states of the USA (tornado alley) in the spring and early summer - very warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, moving north, meets relatively cold air coming from the northwest - which gives massive instability and the windshear required.
They can last from several seconds up to (roughly) 30 minutes - however, most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes
Its speed of movement usually ranges from 20 - 40 kts

A small-scale intense low pressure zone on route would be likely to bring very unsettled weather in that region. The inflow of air near the surface leads to air rising in the core of the low pressure region, and this brings large convective cloud formations, particularly in summer. This would be very likely to cause CBs and thunderstorms. Of course, these would be associated with
heavy rainfall and turbulence
, as well as icing, wind shear, hail, lightning, etc.
As for visibility, low pressure zones like this tend to have good visibility outside of the clouds/precipitation as the mixing of air makes sure the particles causing bad visbility do not sit in a haze (as happens with high pressure). However, there is no option that says this, so for now we have to just assume they are talking about the

This question is really tricky because of its options.
The correct answer is the South-West Monsoon
to our knowledge, as this is the standard name for that monsoon in the syllabus, however,
that is the monsoon that occurs during Summer

So for starters, by the question saying that the South-Easterly trade winds are blowing over India, it means that
the ITCZ has travelled to the North of India
, and therefore it is Northern Hemisphere Summer. The trade-winds actually stop blowing from the SE when they cross over to the Northern Hemisphere, and the Coriolis force (still quite weak near the Equator) begins to turn them to the right instead, so they actually arrive at India from the South-West. They
do not change name
though, we still call them the South-East trade winds as that's what they were originally, when they were in the Southern Hemisphere.
The monsoon is the seasonal change in the wind in India. In the Winter, the
NE Monsoon
blows from the dry plains of the Siberian Peninsula, and in the Summer, the ITCZ goes North of India and the
SW Monsoon

Infrared (IR).
Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image =>
If the clouds near the surface are approx. same temperature as the land surface it can be difficult to distinguish the clouds from land.

An aircraft can only depart if free from ice and other contaminants. No aircraft is certified for take-off with existing ice as take-off performance is not tested in these conditions, even if it is equipped with de-icing equipment.
Airframe Icing can lead to reduced performance, loss of lift, altered controllability and ultimately stall and subsequent loss of control of the aircraft"

HOAR FROST
It occurs when a sub-zero surface comes into contact with moist air
(the ambient temperature is lowered to saturation level). It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air.
Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating).
This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles).
Hoar frost can occur:
on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.
in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases:
If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer.

HOAR FROST
It occurs when a sub-zero surface comes into contact with moist air
(the ambient temperature is lowered to saturation level). It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air.
Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating).
This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles).
Hoar frost can occur:
on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.
in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases:
If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer.
If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion.
The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating."

MONSOONS
A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.
There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.
NE MONSOON:
In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.
It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).
NW MONSOON:
When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.
SW MONSOON:
In Summer – June, July and August
, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).
=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31727""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=3C690618-6953-4ACB-87C2-57A99A3DE66D&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/3C690618-6953-4ACB-87C2-57A99A3DE66D"" alt=""thumb_773_NE.png"" /> </a> </div><div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer31728""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=6D4D6624-78F4-41C3-96B4-D016B260942A&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/6D4D6624-78F4-41C3-96B4-D016B260942A"" alt=""thumb_898_SW .png"" /> </a> </div></div>",73354,"s.

Foehn Effect.
Foehn winds. When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour,
moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes.
As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.
On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation

FRONTAL FOG
.
Occurs at a warm front or occlusion
. The main cause – precipitation lowering the cloud base to the ground. Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night.
The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours.
Orographic lifting => increases the fog intensity
Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the warm front.
Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts
, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low.

The moisture traps additional ice crystals, and, eventually, the ice buildup is shed into the compressor, causing the engine to surge and stall and possibly the combustor, causing a flameout.

"Ice crystal icing poses a significant risk to aircraft engines, as it has been identified as a potential hazard. The crystals responsible for this hazard are typically encountered in high concentrations:","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Within cirrus and cirrostratus cloud at a warm front just below the tropopause in tropical regions.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Within cirrus and cirrostratus cloud at a warm front just below the tropopause in Arctic regions.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Within and downwind of cumulonimbus clouds close to the tropopause in tropical regions.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Close to the tropopause within cumulonimbus clouds that have in Arctic regions.'}]",Within and downwind of cumulonimbus clouds close to the tropopause in tropical regions.,"Refer to figure.
Instances of engine power loss and damage have been observed in convective weather conditions at altitudes typically not associated with traditional icing conditions. Studies indicate that intense convective weather, such as thunderstorm activity, can carry substantial moisture to higher altitudes. At these heights, the moisture can freeze into minuscule ice crystals, potentially as tiny as 40 microns (similar in size to grains of flour). These particular ice crystals have the potential to
impact aircraft engines when flying through convective weather
. To distinguish this type of icing from icing caused by supercooled liquid, the term ""
ice crystal icing

This question is a little tricky as it is asking about
the effect of the
warm front
,
not the foehn effect
.
The warm front means that the air in front of the warm front is colder than the air that comes after the warm front. The warmer air behind rides up over the cooler air in front, creating the slanted front. This slant means that the cloud base drops as the front gets closer to a position. With a few hundred miles to go before the front passes overhead, you can expect high level cirrus clouds, followed by lowering clouds of cirrostratus, altostratus, nimbostratus (rain clouds), and finally low level stratus with some fog and stratus fractus.
In relation to this question then, the front is travelling from West to East, so the front is passing over the western faces of the mountains, which will have a very low cloud base and rain/fog.
The Eastern faces
, however,
have yet to be passed over
, so will have a
higher cloud base than 2 000 ft
, and are in the
cold sector
, so the
temperature will be lower there also.
There are a few questions that exist similar to this, but without the presence of the warm front. This makes them affected more so by the foehn effect, which is where the windward side of the mountains gets rained on, reducing the moisture in the air, so the air is drier and warmer on the lee-side.
The passing of a warm front is a much larger event
, and is therefore enough to negate any such temperature change due to the foehn effect.","<div class=""mt10 fl wd100""> <div class=""fl tc mr20"" id=""annexContainer43683""> <a href=""/ImageViewer/index?image=01560ED8-7E4D-4A59-BA33-F34900864CA8&size=2"" target=""_blank""> <img style=""border: solid thin rgb(219 219 219 / 32%); width: 163px !important; height: 136px !important; "" src=""/getimage/01560ED8-7E4D-4A59-BA33-F34900864CA8"" alt=""thumb_328_warm front.png"" /> </a> </div></div>",82192,".

ADVECTION FOG
. Is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion.
The surface can be land or sea and it can appear by day or night.
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR ADVECTION FOG TO FORM
WIND SPEEDS
. Up to 15 kts to move the air (may be stronger over sea – up to 20 kts).
Wind speeds over 5 kts are sufficient for advection fog formation
, but the speeds of around 15 kts provide the conditions for maximum vertical development of advection fog.
COLD SURFACE. Colder than the dew point of the air moving over it – to ensure condensation.
HUMID AIR
.
High relative humidity – so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent condensation.
TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE.
The greater the temperature difference between the warmer air and the colder ground => the greater the likelihood of fog formation.

"Immediately following an extended flight at high altitude, what phenomenon may be observed to form on the wings after landing, despite the weather at the landing aerodrome being clear, warm and having no visible moisture nearby?","[{'id': 1, 'answer': 'Mixed ice on the leading edges and empennage.'}, {'id': 2, 'answer': 'Ice crystal icing on the leading edges due to the previous cold high-altitude flight.'}, {'id': 3, 'answer': 'Frost forming around the fuel tanks due to cold-soaked wings.'}, {'id': 4, 'answer': 'Clear sheet ice on the lower surface of the wing.'}]",Frost forming around the fuel tanks due to cold-soaked wings.,"Refer to figure.
In this scenario, the aircraft has a very cold airframe, which will warm up quite fast during the descent and landing. The fuel, however, has a much larger thermal mass than the airframe, and will take much longer to warm up.
This means that the wings are what we refer to as ""
cold-soaked
""
, as they will be much colder than the surrounding air for a while.
This can be a problem, even on a nice warm day, depending on the moisture content of the air. If the air has a high enough moisture content, then
any moisture that touches the wing will condense immediately
, but due to the wing being below freezing temperature, will actually turn straight to ice on the wing
(known as sublimation, or deposition, depending on the country). This forms icing on the wing,
