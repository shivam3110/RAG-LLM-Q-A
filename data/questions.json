        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nWhen cold air displaces warm air, it creates a\ncold front\n. On synoptic charts, cold fronts are represented by blue triangles.\nClouds\n: In contrast to warm fronts, cold fronts often bring about a rapid development of clouds, typically occurring 50-100 km ahead of the surface position of the front. These clouds include AC (Altocumulus) and CC (Cirrocumulus) clouds, followed by a sudden appearance of CU (Cumulus) and CB (\nCumulonimbus\n) clouds. These cloud formations are often associated with moderate to severe turbulence.\nPrecipitation\n: Showers of rain, which can be heavy at times, are generated by CU and CB clouds along the cold front. Depending on the intensity and season, these showers can manifest as rain, snow, or hail, and there is also the possibility of thunderstorms forming.\nVisibility\n: Showery precipitation along the cold front typically leads to a reduction in visibility, which can be significant during heavy precipitation and snowfall. However, once the front passes, visibility improves considerably as the falling precipitation helps cleanse the air, removing impurities.",

See the comments for the most recent feedback.\nUPDATE:\nThe Hungarian CAA have approved an appeal based on this question\n(which said that two correct answers were present), stating, \"The cold front is the right option, because clearance occurs with a change of air mass, or less commonly with an increase in surface wind. The term \"on its own\u201d means the weather phenomena associated with cold front. Of course not the definition of cold front will improve the visibility, but the phenomena. Hovewer diurnal solar heating can also be a correct answer.\"\nWe think that the cold front and diurnal solar heating are both perfectly correct, so we hope that they have removed this question from the database now.\nIf this comes up in an exam, you may appeal it, quoting the Hungarian CAA above if necessary.\nRADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth\u2019s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last too long after sunrise, but can stay into the afternoon in certain conditions. Predominantly autumn and winter.\nCONDITIONS LEADING TO DISSIPATION OF RADIATION FOG\nINSOLATION\n- causing convection which will lift the fog. It will also help to evaporate the lower layers.\nSTRONG WIND \u2013 (stronger than 8kt) lifting the fog to form stratus cloud.\nCHANGE OF AIR MASS\n- This is less common, but of course, if a different air mass moves into an area with radiation fog, the new air mass will have different qualities to the old air mass. For example, in this question, the movement of a cold front would mean that\nthe new air is not the same air than cooled overnight close to the ground, and so the radiation fog will dissipate\n. This is particularly rare though, as a new air mass means that some wind is blowing, which would usually stop radiation fog from forming in the first place. Nonetheless, this stronger wind is another reason that the cold front would dissipate the fog.",

        "explanation": "An isothermal layer is defined as a vertical column of air having a constant temperature with height.\nIsothermal layers often occur in the low levels of the troposphere during a differential advection situation.\nThe air within an isothermal layer is stable.To cause air in an isothermal layer to rise it must be forced lifted since it will not rise on its own.\nStability of the atmosphere can be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate):\nAbsolute stability:\nELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8\u00b0C per 1 000 ft (0.6\u00b0C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR.\nAbsolute instability:\nELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3\u00b0C per 1 000 ft (1\u00b0C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR.\nConditional instability:\nELR is between 1.8\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR.\nBecause in an isothermal layer the temperature does not change with altitude, the ELR is 0 and thus less than the SALR.That is why an isothermal layer is absolutely stable.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFOEHN EFFECT\nFoehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope\n\u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nWith regards to this question\n, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds.\nThe north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer.\nTherefore, temperature is higher north of the Alps than south of the Alps at the same altitude.",

This happens because as the area pressure increases you try and keep the plane reading the required altitude (in this case 5000 ft) and, therefore, willingly climb. So to keep your plane at the correct altitude above the ground you would have to change the sub-scale to the higher setting, in this case from 1016 hPa to 1018 hPa.\nFlying from Low to High\n, the altimeter will indicate lower than the actual altitude above sea level.\nThe aircraft\u2019s altitude will slowly increase\nwhile the altimeter remains constant; therefore, the ALTIMETER is indicating a LOWER altitude then what the aircraft is actually flying.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter\n\u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. I\nt also affects SE India\n, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Insolation gives rise to convection currents - with warm air rising and cooler air descending, which are responsible for bumpy conditions as an airplane flies in and out of them.\n-\nThermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 hrs on clear sunny days (when the highest temperatures are reached)\n- In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.\nMECHANICAL/FRICTIONAL TURBULENCE\nFriction between the air and the ground\n, especially irregular terrain and man-made obstacles (such as hills, mountains, coasts, trees and buildings\n)\n, causes eddies and therefore turbulence in the lower levels.\n- This kind of turbulence will increase as the wind speed increases.",

We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front.\nIn the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain.\nAt\nlocation 4\n, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain and heavy rain ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. Ahead of the warm front where the freezing level in the cold air is lower than the freezing level in the warm air above it, as the rain falls from the warmer air (above 0\u00b0C) into the cold air (below 0\u00b0C) below it freezes, forming\nfreezing rain\n.\nThis would line up with the METAR in the question\n.\nAt location 3\n, once the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the winter.\nLocation 2\nis just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds.\nLocation 1\nis after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties.",

        "explanation": "An inversion in the atmosphere is where temperature rises with an increase in height. This produces extreme stability\nThere are four kinds of inversions: ground, turbulence, subsidence, and frontal.\nGROUND INVERSION\n- develops when air is cooled by contact with a colder surface until it becomes cooler than the overlying atmosphere\n; this occurs most often on clear nights, when the ground cools off rapidly by radiation.\nIf the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result.\nTURBULENCE INVERSION - often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air. Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing\u00a0carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer. The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then exists.\nSUBSIDENCE\u00a0INVERSION - develops when a widespread layer of air descends. The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and, as a result, the lapse rate of temperature is reduced. If the air mass\u00a0sinks low enough, the air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion.\nFRONTAL\u00a0INVERSION - occurs when a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass and lifts it aloft; the front between the two air masses then has warm air above and cold air below.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from\n0\u00baC to -30\u00baC\n, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(\nSmall supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature.\nIn the case of this specific question:\nThe question asks about the QFE and QNH at an airport situated 50 feet below sea level.\nBecause of this the QFE will be measured 50 feet below sea level, the QNH will still be measured at sea level which is 50 feet higher.\nWe know that a higher altitude has a lower pressure, so the barometric value of QNH is lower than QFE.\nWe can say that QNH is always greater or equal to QFE except when the airport is situated under sea level.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCOLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL\nA cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nAs a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night.\nA Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion.\nThe following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet:\nThere should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion.\nThe structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase.\nIf the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet",

        "explanation": "Clear Ice or Glaze Ice\nIf a\nlarge supercooled water droplet\nstrikes an aircraft, it will start to freeze and this will\nrelease latent heat. This will delay the freezing process whilst part of the supercooled water droplet will\nflow back over the impact surface\nforming clear ice. The amount of a supercooled water droplet that freezes on impact is 1/80th of the droplet for each degree below freezing.\nClear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing.\nThe ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the build-up can be uneven. It is illustrated in\nFigure 16.1\n.\nPropeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage.\nClear ice forms in Ns, Cu and Cb at temperatures from\n0 to -20 \u00b0C\n.\nIt is the most dangerous form of icing because 1) of the speed at which it can build up on the aircraft and 2) it might be very difficult to detect due to its transparency.",

Therefore, we only need to aply the temperature correction.\nThe ISA deviation is ISA -10\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-10) \u00d7 (9 500/1000) =\n380 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is\nsubtracted\nfrom the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 9 500 ft - 380 ft =\n9 120\nft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Isobars are closely spaced together.\nIn a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude.\nIf the air is initially humid, this general lifting, in the centre of a depression, leads to condensation and formation of clouds. If the air is unstable, CB clouds may form. Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers,\nWeather associated with Low Pressure Systems:\n- CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause\n- PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression.\n- VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air\n- TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air\n- WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.

Wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the\nPressure Gradient Force PGF\n(\nfrom high to low\n).\n2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis force CF begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90\u00ba angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF.\n3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars \u2013 PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces).",

When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.\n\"Between the tops of two cumulonimbus clouds.\"\nIncorrect\n.\nAn equalisation of charge only occurs between one positively charged and one negatively charged area.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nConvection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature.\nConvection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated\u2014i.e., to become less dense and to rise.\nWhen two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly.\nThe process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows:\nThe sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it.\nAs the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction.\nBecause surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.\nThe faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and\nhigher\nup into the atmosphere the\nconvection\nextends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.)\nIn the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons.\nDuring noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point.\nAt this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time.\nThe temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

The annex above caters mostly for standard airframe icing, but we must be able to recognise the danger of ICI in the top sections also, which contain the ice crystals.\nThese tropical storms that bring high IWC are\nareas of extreme convective activity\n, and the region around the tops of these clouds (and within those clouds) is the most dangerous location for experiencing Ice Crystal Icing.",

Approx. at the cold air tropopause level (below the warm air tropopause level).\nAnother area of strong shear is situated at the border of the upper level front.\nThese areas are identified by red arrow on the attached figures.\nNote: Strong CAT areas are identified on charts by very close spacing of isotachs.\nNote:\nCore of the jet stream is located in the warm air\n\u2013 above the level of cold air tropopause and below the warm air tropopause\n.\nAs can be seen in the first annex above, the highest CAT does exist at and above the tropopause near the core, as well as in the region of the front.

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nIt is easier to answer this question if we first understand why the remaining options are not correct.\n\"\nOn a flight from Zurich to Rome you have not to worry about moderate and/or severe turbulence at FL 150.\n\"\nINCORRECT\n. As you can see in the attached chart, the first part of the flight between Zurich and Rome will be across an area where moderate turbulence and icing are forecasted from a level below FL100 up to FL180 => which means that at FL150 we can expect moderate turbulence.\n\"\nBetween Paris and Amsterdam moderate icing conditions above FL140 are forecast.\n\"\nINCORRECT.\nThe entire flight between Paris and Amsterdam will be in an area where moderate turbulence and icing are forecasted from a level below FL100 up to FL140 => moderate icing is not forecasted for a level above FL140.\n\"\nOver Frankfurt at FL 290 moderate, occasionally severe turbulence must be expected.\n\"\nINCORRECT\n. Do not be tricked by this one. Even though it might seem that Frankfurt is in CAT area 2 - it is not. Frankfurt is located in CAT area 4 - and in this area, moderate turbulence is forecasted between FL180 and FL420. No severe turbulence is expected.\n\"\nThe wind speed in the core of the jet stream west of Rome is about 80 kt\n.\"\nCORRECT\n. Now, this is the only remaining option. The only logical explanation we can find is that if you follow this jet stream from the Ireland area, going down towards Rome => you can see that its speed tendency is to reduce steadily by 20 kts. Close to Ireland => 140 kt; followed by 120 kts north of Zurich; then 100 kts over North Italy => we can expect its speed would have reduced to 80 kts by the time it reached Rome.\nMore importantly, we can also see that it stops being a jet stream just abeam Rome, which means that the core wind speed drops below 80 kts.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure\nAhead of a warm front, freezing rain can be encountered\n. Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0\u00b0C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled.\nIt can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice\n.\nClear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing\n, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.\nNow, let's analyse each option individually:\n\"Fly along searching for an opening.\" and \"Orbit and wait for improvement.\".\nIncorrect\n.\nThe question states that the pilot is in the planning phase, it does not make sense to plan an orbit. In such circumstances, it is safer and cost-effective to delay the departure. Furthermore, flying along the front trying to find an opening is rarely an option due to fuel available and airspace restrictions.\n\"Descend low as possible, staying at 500 ft AGL, even if it means flying below MSA and entering IMC.\"\nIncorrect\n. MSA stands for minimum sector altitude, an aircraft must not descend below the local MSA.\n\"Plan his/her route through the warm front on the shortest way possible.\"\nCorrect\n.\nThis is the most correct option available. Avoid any signs of precipitation.",

It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces:\nPGF\nCF\nCentrifugal Force\n(acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation)\nGRADIENT WIND IN A LOW\nThe Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed.\nTherefore, for the same isobar spacing,\ngradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind.\nPGF = CF + Centrifugal Force\nGRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH\nThe Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed.\nTherefore, for the same isobar spacing\n, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.\nCF = PGF + Centrifugal Force\nHENCE, the relationship being:\nVST < VHigh and VST > VLow.\nNote that we are comparing the gradient wind in a LOW/HIGH to the equivalent Geostrophic wind and not the gradient wind around a HIGH to the gradient wind around a LOW.",

Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown\nthat strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity)\ncan lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off.

They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.\nHow does a Valley Inversion form?\nThe temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.\nConsequently,\nthe colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes.\nThe temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.\nThus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.\nAbove the inversion, wind direction and speed may change significantly. Consequently, when crossing the top of the inversion, strong windshear (from 30 to 50 kt) may be expected.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture,\nproducing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon)\n.\nThe SW Monsoon affects all of India\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

One starts high pressure and gets higher with altitude (warm high), and the other starts high pressure and gets lower with altitude (cold high).\nCold anticyclones\nform over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result.\nThe cold highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW).\nIsobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights; they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards.\nWarm anticyclones\n(so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.\nThe warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.\nPressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>\nIsobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels.\nFurthermore,\nisobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate high pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate low pressure.",

As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.\nThe faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the\nconvection\nextends.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLIGHTNING\nAs a towering cumulus develops, a large electrical charge separation builds up within the cloud.\nLighting results when this electrical charge becomes strong enough to jump from the cloud to the ground,\nto another cloud, or to an opposite electrical charge within the same cloud.\nIn the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.\nTypes of lightning:\nIntra-Cloud lightning\n:\nThe most common type of lightning.\nIt happens inside the cloud\n, jumping between different charge regions in the cloud. It lights up the cloud to look like the picture above.\nCloud-to-air lightning:\nReferring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud.\nCloud-to-cloud lightning:\nHappens when a negatively charged cloud finds a positively charged cloud and opposites attract. The discharge travels from cloud to cloud.\nCloud-to-ground lightning:\nOccurs between the cloud and the ground.",

You'll observe that the end of the measured distance falls slightly to the left of the 40 kt curved line. Therefore, we can deduce that the speed of the\ngeostrophic wind at position 45\u00b0N 030\u00b0W is slightly\ngreater than 40 knots\n.\nFor determining the wind direction:\nAt position 45\u00b0N 030\u00b0W, draw a straight line parallel to the 1 012 hPa and 1 016 hPa isobars. According to Buys Ballot's Law, in the Northern Hemisphere, the lower pressure is on our left when we have our back to the wind. Thus, we can conclude that the geostrophic wind at position 45\u00b0N 030\u00b0W is blowing from the\nsouthwest\n.\nBased on the preceding information and the available choices, we can assert that the geostrophic wind at position 45\u00b0N 030\u00b0W is roughly\n210\u00ba/45 kt.",

        "explanation": "QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time.\nIf you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero.\nQNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere.\nIf you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and\nif you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions\n( that is if QNH=QFF).\nBecause the airport is situated 400 meters above sea level with a QFF of 1016 and the question states the air temperature is 10 degrees lower than ISA, we can calculate the QNH.\n400m x 3,285 = 1314 feet\nX 1,04 (4 % temperature correction for every 10 degrees below ISA) = 1366,6 feet\n/ 27 (drop of 1 hPa according to ISA near the ground) = 50,6 hPa\n1314 feet / 27 = 48,7 hPa\n50,6 -48,7 = roughly 2 hPa. So, the QNH will be 1014 and the QFF = 1016.\nWe do not need to do these time-consuming calculations because most of the questions just ask if the QNH would be more or less than QFF.\nActual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is colder than ISA, the air is more dense and thus pressure will drop faster with altitude.\nQNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet.\nBecause at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted.\nThe QNH in this case needs to be\nlowered\n(lower than 1016) because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will overread.\nRemember:\nABOVE MSL:\nTemp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH\nTemp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH\nBELOW MSL:\nTemp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH\nTemp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nWEATHER ATTENUATION\nThe weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs.\nThe stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,\nRadar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.\nTip for avoiding shadows:\nTo accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.\nIf you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.\nIf you don\u2019t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it\u2019s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

        "explanation": "DEW POINT TEMPERATURE\nThe dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to (at constant pressure) in order to achieve saturation (= a relative humidity (RH) of 100%). In simple words, it is the temperature at which the air can no longer \"hold\" all of the water vapour which is mixed with it - and some of the water vapour must condense into liquid water.\nRemember that warm air can take in more water than cold air (due to the air expanding). Cold air can take in less water than warm air (due to air being compressed). So, as air cools, its ability to hold water decreases. Likewise, as air heats up its ability to hold water increases.\nWith regards to this question\n, think of it as a plastic bag filled with water. If you squeeze it, water will come out but it will remain filled. The same will happen in this case, when we reach the dew point, the parcel is fully saturated, if we keep on cooling the parcel it will shrink more and excessive water vapour will condense into liquid water (\nthe actual water vapour content decreases\n).",

        "explanation": "If the real temperature conditions were equal to ISA conditions, the thickness of this layer would be 9 000 ft\n,\nhowever this is not the case.\nThe ISA deviation is ISA -15\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows:\nCorrection for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (15) \u00d7 (9000/1000) =\n540 ft\n.\nYou have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL50 and FL140  individually or to the layer thickness (FL140 \u2013 FL50). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.\nIn the case of a colder air mass, the deviation causes a thinner layer, so we must subtract the temperature correction of 540 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 8460 ft.\nRULES\n-The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u2018\n4 %-rule\n\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE",

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas.\nTHE EYE is found in the centre of the storm and, typically, has a diameter of 30-50 km (10-20 NM). Within the eye, the lowest surface pressures and calmest conditions are found.\nTHE EYE WALL\nhuge cumulonimbus clouds (Its cloud tops height reach 12-15, to 16 km) surround the eye, creating the eye wall.\nThe eye wall is where the most active CBs are found with the strongest winds and most severe turbulence.\nIt is the most dangerous part of a tropical revolving storm.",

        "correct_answer": "towards the area of convergence, across the isobars marked on the chart.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nA synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area.\nPressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force.\nThe coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means\nthat air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force.\nThis makes it very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving. There is, however, some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more.\nThe outflow of air from a high is called divergence\n. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days.\nThe inflow of air into a low is called convergence\n.\nAs the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather.\nIn this question, they are asking about\nthe atmospheric convergence from a low pressure zone\n. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel\nacross the isobars\nand\ntowards towards the low pressure.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTroposphere\n= The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level.\nNearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.\nWith increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.\nStratosphere\n= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.\nThis is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.\nThe lower boundary of the stratosphere is called\nthe tropopause\n; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.\nMesosphere\n= The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.\nThe air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are found here.\nThermosphere\n= The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees.\nExosphere\n= The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth.\nHowever, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space.\nIn the case of this specific question\n: As you can see in the image, the temperature first decreases with altitude in the troposphere, in the stratosphere the temperature increases with altitude.This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere.So that is why the division between the troposphere and the stratosphere can be made according the temperature profile.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA very large factor in the formation of turbulence is the\natmospheric stability\n. In essence, stability is the measurement of how air reacts to being forced upwards. If air is forced to rise by some force, once the force disappears,\nstable air will begin to sink back to the original altitude\n, and\nunstable air will continue to rise\n.\nThis is all to do with\nthe temperature of the different layers of atmosphere, called the Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR)\n. If there is a high ELR, then the atmosphere drops in temperature with altitude quite rapidly. If there is a low ELR, it means that the temperature does not drop as quickly with altitude, and even an ELR of 0 (an isothermal layer) or an increase of temperature with altitude (an inversion) can also occur.\nThe air which is forced to rise will not change temperature at the ELR though, it changes temperature with the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate = 3\u00baC/1000ft) when unsaturated, or the SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate [variable, usually around 1.8\u00baC/1000ft; always less than the DALR]) when fully saturated with water vapour. If this makes the air parcel warmer than the surrounding atmosphere, then the atmosphere is unstable, and will rise, and the opposite for if it becomes cooler than the atmosphere.\nThis creates 3 regions of stability:\nAbsolute stability, when the ELR is less than the SALR.\nConditional stability, when the ELR is between the SALR and the DALR. (saturated air is unstable but dry air is stable in this atmosphere)\nAbsolute instability, when the ELR is greater than the DALR.\nA good way to remember which way round these are is that isothermal layers and inversions are always absolutely stable, and act like an air blockade.\nStability\ncauses less uplift in the atmosphere, allowing for smoother flying conditions with\nless turbulence\nwhich is when\nthe ELR is less than the SALR.\nRealistically there is no need to look at the figure in the question, the E sector does appear to be unstable but the question would have the same answer if no figure were presented.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nStructural Icing: It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.\nWings that are\nthin\nor have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.\nThere are 2 general types of structural icing:\nRIME ICE\nNormally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of\nlarge water droplets\nthat are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -10\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious\nof the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\n\u21d2 Therefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter\n\u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013\nbringing cool and dry continental air\n. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Hence advection of cold air over a warm surface leads to instability.\nFinally, the cold air will start to get heated from below and, consequently, will rise into colder air above where it adiabatically cools down, condenses and releases latent heat -\nwhich fuels the convective process providing a lifting action.",

They are fairly distinct and easy to classify in relation to other clouds: they\u2019re a cumulus cloud that\u2019s wider than tall. They\u2019re flattened cumulus and are generally found low in altitude.\nIts vertical growth is usually restricted by the existence of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere -\ncooling of the surface stops convection and increases stability in the airmass which causes clouds to dissipate\n.\nWithin the cloud, ascending currents of about 2\u20135 m/s (7\u201317 ft/s) may be encountered. Turbulence is sometimes severe, especially during the formation and growth of the cloud, and it diminishes when the cloud is mature. Air below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the thermals that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride. To avoid turbulence where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops.",

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -20\u00baC\n. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 12 290 ft - 5 100 ft =\n7 190 ft\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-20) \u00d7 (7 190/1000) =\n-575\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded to\nthe true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad12 865 ft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. The local pressure equals standard, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded.\nThe lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is\nFL\n1\n30\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account.

In fact, empirical rules can be used to relate values of visibility with the most probable value of RVR (see IP3 from the sixth meeting of this study group). These findings are consistent with the fact that the assessment of RVR takes advantage of high intensity runway lights while the visibility assessment is based upon lights of moderate intensity\nNote: \"measured with ceilometers alongside the runway.\" INCORRECT. RVR is measured with transmissometers.

Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR.\nAbsolute instability:\nELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3\u00b0C per 1 000 ft (1\u00b0C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR.\nConditional instability:\nELR is between 1.8\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR.\nBecause in an isothermal layer the temperature does not change with altitude, the\nELR is 0 and thus less than the SALR\n.

In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -8\u00baC. The airfield elevation must be taken into consideration for the temperature correction: 2 600 ft - 600 ft = 2 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-8) \u00d7 (2 000/1000) = -64 ft.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad2 536\nf\nt\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account.

Because air in clouds is rising with SALR - air is saturated (moist). Saturated air cools down slower and as long as enough moisture is available the cloud will keep growing. When SALR = ELR (temperature of air parcel in cloud = temperature of environment) the parcel of air cannot ascend (rise) any more because there is no difference in temperature (no difference in density). Hence, top of clouds is defined.",

The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated.\nIn the case of this specific question:\nBecause QNH at Palma de Mallorca is the same as in Marseille the pressure is not changed.\nIf, however the true altitude is constantly increasing this would mean that the temperature must be changing.The only way the true altitude is increasing is if the temperature is increasing (warmer than ISA altimeter will under read).Because we now know the altimeter functions correctly no actions should be taken.The increase of true altitude is due to the warmer air mass over Palma de Mallorca.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart\nand higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

Polar front Jets are caused by the upper pressure gradient between the Tm warm and Pm cold air masses on either side of the polar front\n=> Polar air is significantly colder than the tropical air mass in the winter which causes stronger winds (due to steeper temperature differences) than in the summer.\n=> For that reason, in the southern hemisphere, winds are strongest in July (winter).\nCore altitude approx. 30 000 \u2013 35 000ft.\nIts position tends to travel with the polar front.\nWinter - located between 25\u00b0N-40\u00b0N and 40\u00baS.

A sudden decrease is usually observed at the front. Behind the cold front, it remains steady (cold).\nPressure\n:\nbefore the front, it decreases slightly\n. At the front it starts to rise (after reaching its lowest value). A slow increase is observed behind the front.\nClouds\n: At the cold front, BKN to OVC layers may occur with CU and CB.\nHowever, if the air is stable\ncold fronts can also produce nimbostratus clouds (\nand\nstratocumulus, and stratus clouds.)\nPrecipitation\n: heavy rain or snow showers can be expected. Along with thunderstorms and hail, if the air is unstable.\nVisibility\n:\ngood, except in precipitation.\n=> Considering the above, we can conclude a cold front in stable atmosphere is being described.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLearning Objective 050.06.02.08.01: Describe the movements of fronts and pressure systems and the life cycle of a mid-latitude depression.\nA mid latitude depression (also called a polar front depression, or a travelling low), is a key part of the global climate and air circulation pattern. It sits on the \"Polar Front\", which is the front between the cold Polar Cell and the warmer Ferrel Cell of the atmosphere, somewhere between 30\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 N/S, depending on the season. From here on we will discuss it in relation to the Northern Hemisphere, but just reverse the North and South directions for the Southern Hemisphere Polar Front.\nTo the North of the Polar Front sits the high pressure zone of the North Pole and the very cold Arctic Circle. To the South of the Polar front sits the subtropical high pressure belt (the Azores high in the Atlantic). This means that the air wants to flow towards the Polar Front from both directions (pressure gradient force), but the air turns right due to the Coriolis effect, so\nthe wind to the North of the front is East-to-West\nand\nthe air to the South of the front is West-East\n. This scenario is\nunstable\n, and gives rise to\ntravelling lows\n.\nRefer to the annex above - it uses different names for the stages.\nInitial stage (Frontogenesis)\n- The first stage is triggered by a small change in circumstances, the triggers are many, but are not important. The warm air mass begins to push into the cold air mass, creating a kink in the previously non-moving Polar Front.\nMature Stage\n- This is where the cold sector begins to \"fight back\", and develops a cold front to claim back some of the land from the warm sector. The depression usually reaches its lowest pressure in this stage, and this stage can last for a good few days. It brings the familiar view of a cold front \"chasing a warm front\".\nOccluded Stage\n- The cold front has now caught up to the warm front at the centre of the depression, where the weather appears to look like both fronts pass together. Here, the warm sector no longer reaches the ground, and has been lifted into the air in this region. The fronts continue to occlude, and act like a clothing zipper, \"zipping up\" from the base out towards the edge.\nDying Stage\n- The fronts are now almost completely occluded, and the depression is beginning to \"fill in\" with pressure. The whole system is beginning to collapse and the warm sector which initially invaded has become isolated from the rest of the warm air to the south, and is forced upwards into the atmosphere where it will disperse. A few things can happen here, including back-bent occlusions, and secondary depressions which may continue to develop.\nThe dying stage is often accelerated by the depression moving over land, where the air has more friction with the land, and there is no longer a steady source of moisture beneath to feed the system.\nThrough this whole life cycle, the system is moving towards the East (with some North/South movement according to the Jetstream, Polar Front, etc.), as\nthe wind in the warm sector controls the direction.",

        "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.02.05.01.05: Describe that mountain wave effects can exceed the performance or structural capability of aircraft.\nHaving fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with\nlarge updrafts\non the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as\nlarge downdrafts\non the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue\ndownwind of the high ground\nsimilar to waves on the ocean\n, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases.\nThe downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one.\nWhilst\nthe wind is relatively smooth in general, there is a significant amount of windshear\n, causing heavy turbulence and rotor effects underneath the peaks of the wave. Mountain waves are not just at the height of the mountain peaks though, as\nthey affect the air above themselves\nalso, and, given the right conditions, can propagate as high as the tropopause.\nLenticular clouds indicate the presence of mountain waves, and even though they look very calm, they are extremely dangerous to fly near, due to the effects mentioned above.

        "correct_answer": "3 515 ft",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 983 hPa = 30 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 30 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n810 ft\n.\nThis value needs to be\nsubtracted\nfrom the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude\n= 5 000 ft - 810 ft =\n4 190\nft.\nTo determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (5 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (5 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad+5\u00baC. The actual outside air temperature is also +5 \u00baC, which means OAT = ISA. Therefore,\nthe temperature correction may be disregarded.\nNext, we need to calculate the elevation of the aerodrome: QNH - QFE = 983 hPa - 958 hPa = 25 hPa\nThe question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa:\n25 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 675 ft airfield elevation\nThe true height of the aeroplane below the aerodrome = 4 190 ft \u2013 675 ft =\n3 515 ft\nbelow the ground of the aerodrome.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

This sector shows Isolated scattered/broken cumulus and stratocumulus - with\nmoderate icing\nto the East of the sector, we are in the West of the sector so\nthat does not affect us\n- and moderate turbulence between 2000-4000 and 5000ft. We can expect\nmoderate turbulence at 3000 ft\nfor this section of flight, but no icing.\nIn the second half of flight, we pass through sector \"B\" which has an occluded front followed by a slow moving cold/warm front reversal, so many different weather conditions can be expected in this area. In terms of icing and turbulence, sector \"B\" contains cumulus and stratocumulus clouds which are overcast in the frontal areas between 1500-3000ft and 5000-8000ft. We are expected to pass through these clouds at 3000ft which would give\nmoderate turbulence again, with moderate icing also\nnow.\nNote: the 0\u2070C level in sector \"B\" is between 4000 ft and 6000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0\u2070C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case. Also, NASA quotes ice as being worst between +2\u2070C and -20\u2070C, so we know it can happen in low positive temperatures.

Mountainous areas can produce mountain waves, especially when a stable atmosphere exists (so the air flows down again after being forced upwards), and mountain waves can travel way up into the atmosphere when there is a gradually strengthening wind, which would likely be the case if a jet stream is present at high altitudes.\nThe aircraft is a jet aircraft in the cruise, so we can assume it is at high altitude, around the region of 30 000 - 45 000 ft, just inside or above the jetstream. To give an answer to this question, we\ncan be almost certain that there will be clear air turbulence occuring due to the jetstream\n, and we could potentially expect to see some mountain waves from the mountainous area below, but that is a much bigger assumption to make, and\nit is definitely not assured that mountain waves will form at all, and therefore even less likely that we will feel them at cruising altitude.\nTherefore,\nwe are more likely to see clear air turbulence.\nAlso, mountain waves do cause turbulence, often without clouds, so the effect is also classed as clear air turbulence.\nTo deal with the less likely options,\ncumulonimbus activity and altocumulus clouds require an unstable atmosphere\n.",

It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10\u00b0C and -10\u00b0C.\nLightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory.\nThis happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.\nThe main effects of a lightning strike are:\nTemporary blindness of the pilots\nMinor airframe damage\nMagnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked\nDisruption to electrical equipment",

        "explanation": "LOW LEVEL JET STREAMS\nA nocturnal low-level jet\nis a fast-moving air current in the lower atmosphere\nduring night time when the skies are clear\n. As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night.\nA Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion.\nThe following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet:\nThere should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop\n. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion.\nThe structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase.\nIf the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet\nThe other options here are either incorrect or made up by the examiner.\nThe polar night jet is another term for the arctic jetstream as far as we can tell. It happens around 20 000 ft around the poles during their winter, when they get extremely cold due to the polar night.\nA low-level sting jet is a mostly made up term.\nSting jets are a thing to do with weather forecasting and can form very powerful storms but these jets are at high level, not formed in this way, and are way off the ATPL syllabus.\nA squall line jet is not a thing. Squall lines are line of thunderstorms, so certainly not the case in this scenario.",

As the movement begins, the Coriolis force CF begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars \u2013 PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other.\nGEOSTROPHIC WIND:\nOccurs above the friction layer.\nOccurs at a latitude greater than 15 degrees.\nOccurs when the isobars are straight, parallel and equidistant (constant gradient).\nOccurs when the pressure situation is not changing rapidly (constant gradient/equidistant).",

As described in the question text, the rain falls from the cloud layer at 4000 ft,\nwhere the temperature is above 0\u00baC.\n- One of the requirements for icing to form on an aircraft is that the air temperature is below 0\u00baC.

Furthermore, overcast layer of clouds would be expected just ahead of the warm front, with relatively low cloud bases. Instead, \"no significant clouds\" are forecasted for 0700 UTC.\n\"EDDL\" is\nCORRECT\n. Considering the TAF, we can expect the warm front to be quite far away from the airport at 0600 UTC. We can expect EDDL to be situated in the rain belt of the warm front at around 1100 UTC - it makes sense that rain is in the next forecast (for 1300 UTC), along with overcast clouds.",

Wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force PGF (from high to low).\n2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis force CF begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere\n. If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90\u00ba angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF.\n3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars \u2013 PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces).\nGeostrophic wind:\nOccurs above the friction layer.\nOccurs at a latitude greater than 15 degrees.\nOccurs when the isobars are straight, parallel and equidistant (constant gradient).\nOccurs when the pressure situation is not changing rapidly (constant gradient/equidistant).",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nIce crystal icing\n(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that\nstrong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.\nHow does a Valley Inversion form?\nThe temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.\nConsequently,\nthe colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes.\nThe temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.\nThus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

It takes roughly 2 h to orbit the earth. This satellite orbits between 820 and 870 km above the surface and covers a band 1500 NM wide. Picture definition is good due to its relatively low orbit height \u2013\nmaking it possible to identify fog.\nGeostationary satellites\nare put into orbit over the Equator and they take 24 hours to complete the orbit. Their orbit is considerably higher than the polar orbiting satellites (36000 km) and picture definition may not be as good, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted towards the poles.\nThere are two methods of producing the weather picture; visual photography and infrared.\nVisual Images\n.\nAlthough visual photography may be easy to interpret, it su\ufb00ers the disadvantage of not being available continuously, due to lack of sunlight at night. Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black\n- Visible satellite image show solid clouds (such as CBs) as bright white and wispy clouds (thin or faint cloud - such as cirrus) as translucent whitish layers.\nInfrared (IR)\n.\nInfrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image.\nTo get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images.\nIf both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area.\nIf you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud or fog.\nIf you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus\n.",

The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.\nThus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is formed.\n=>\nSince inversions occur most often during the night, its effects will be more marked in the early morning.\nMoreover, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we descend through an inversion,\ntemperature decreases with a decrease in height => we will experience an increased aircraft performance\n, l\neading to an increase in thrust\nand lift, as we dense into colder and denser air.\n\"after a short period of bumpiness\" explained:\nTemperature Inversions are associated with potential windshear at the top of the inversion.\nDue to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>\nwind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above.\nThis wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion\nand turbulence.",

        "correct_answer": "Level flight below a rain-producing cloud when OAT is below zero degrees C.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThe correct option describes the ideal conditions for Freezing Rain.\nFreezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0\u00b0C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0\u00b0C.\nNow, f\nreezing Rain can cause significant accumulations\nof clear ice.\nClear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing\n. The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nClear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice.\n\"Level flight in\nsnowfall\nbelow a nimbostratus layer.\" INCORRECT. Snow is solid precipitation in the form of ice crystals. Remember that for airframe icing to form water must be present in liquid state.\n\"Flying in dense cirrus clouds.\" INCORRECT.\nYou are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.",

This is due to the friction forces between the air and the ground.

Looking at the above we know the surface wind backs in direction and decrease in strength. So, if we go up in altitude, we can expect the wind to veer about 30 degrees and the speed to double.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nHUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.\nHumidity Measurement\nAbsolute Humidity\nRefers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3\nSaturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)\nMaximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.\nHumidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)\nThe ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.\nExpressed as g/kg of dry air.\nRelative Humidity (RH)\nThe ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.\nDepends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.\nRH = (HMR/SMR) x 100\nRH 100% = Saturation\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.\nFrom the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.\nRelative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn\u2019t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.\nNote: Dew point is a more reliable indicator of humidity than relative humidity because dew point\nis not affected by a change in air temperature\nand doesn\u2019t fluctuate much throughout the day.",

If it falls through warmer air before reaching the ground, it can melt and turn to rain droplets. If it then falls through cold air again before hitting the ground,\nthe droplets can become supercooled\n(which means that they are still falling in liquid state, even though their temperature is below 0\u00baC).\nFreezing rain is a rare type of liquid precipitation that strikes a surface and freezes almost instantly.\n=> Now that we understand how freezing rain is formed, we can conclude that freezing rain is depicted in\ndiagram 4\n\u2013 it shows that a cloud at about 1km (3000 ft) will have a temperature above 0\u00baC and could produce rain or drizzle. Below 3000 ft, the temperature is below 0\u00baC and this will result in freezing rain.",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.\nIt is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL 050 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1030 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 5 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the surrounding traffic. In this case, the aircraft is referring to their indicated altitude rather than the pressure altitude they should be using.\nLet\u2019s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure:\n1030 \u2013 1013 = 17 hPa\nUsing the assumed barometric lapse rate of\n30 ft/hPa\n:\n17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft\nThe aircraft is 510 ft above or below the required flight level. to find this out, we can use the rules that state:\nWhen QNH is\nhigher\nthan standard --> Indicated altitude is\nhigher\nthan pressure altitude.\nWhen QNH is\nlower\nthan standard --> Indicated altitude is\nlower\nthan pressure altitude.\nThe aircraft's indicated altitude is therefore higher than pressure altitude,\nso their actual pressure altitude is 510 ft lower than the required 5000 ft\n, making the pressure altitude\n4490ft\n.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used unless specified otherwise in the question.",

        "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere:\nHigh pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction.\nLow pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction.\nIf you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your\nleft-hand\nside.\nTherefore, if\nthe wind is coming from the right, such as in this question,\nthe aircraft is flying from\nlow pressure to high pressure\n. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but\ntheir true altitude will gradually increase.\nThe nice thing about this question is that we\ndo not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for\n. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with\na strong crosswind from the right, the aircraft's true altitude will be increasing\n(unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations).\nTo go through the options:\n\"The aircraft's true altitude will be increasing.\"\nCorrect, as explained above.\n\"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\"\nThe aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190).\n\"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\"\nRadio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work.\n\"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\"\nThe pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

        "explanation": "Note: Remember that Geostrophic force is not Geostrophic Wind. GF is, in other words, Coriolis Force.\nGEOSTROPHIC FORCE\nThe geostrophic wind flows parallel to straight isobars, limiting its movement to a straight trajectory. The geostrophic wind is under the influence of two primary forces: the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and the Coriolis Force (CF).\nThe PGF prompts air movement from regions of high pressure towards those of low pressure, acting at a right angle (90\u00b0) to the isobars. In the absence of the Coriolis Force, air would move directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, perpendicular to the isobars. However, the Coriolis Force (CF) plays a role in the air's motion, which changes with latitude and wind speed. (\nAt the Equator, CF is negligible and it strengthens as one moves towards the poles; it also intensifies with increasing wind speed\n.) As the air begins moving, the CF, acting at a 90\u00b0 angle to the airflow, deflects it (to the right in the Northern hemisphere). When the CF combines with the PGF, the airflow's velocity increases due to this additional force. Consequently, the CF's influence grows, leading to further deflection and increased speed, creating a feedback loop. Eventually, the CF strengthens to the point of equilibrium with the PGF, causing the airflow to become parallel to the isobars.\nThe Geostrophic Force increases with the speed of the air, and it is dependent on the sine of the latitude,\nbeing maximum at the Poles\n(sin 90\u00b0 = 1) and zero at the Equator.",

These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.\nThe warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.\nPressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>\nIsobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels.\nFurthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February\n, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.\nAs we have seen above, the SW Monsoon occurs between June and August and the NE Monsoon occurs between December and February => the transition between these two occurs between September and November.",

ISA surface temperature is +15\u00baC.\n- To find ISA standard temperature for a given altitude, here's a rule of thumb: double the altitude, subtract 15 and place a - sign in front of it.\nISA temperature = 15 \u2013 [(height/1000) x 2]\nISA temperature at 18 000 ft = 15 - [(18 000/1000) x 2] = -21\u00baC\nWhich means that the actual temperature is colder than ISA (ISA -14\u00baC) => we know that density is indirectly proportional to temperature.\nWhich means that if temperature is colder than ISA at this level - density will be greater than the density at the same level but under ISA conditions.",

Ice crystals previously were thought to be harmless to airplanes because they will not adhere to the external airframe, and will simply bounce off the airframe without accreting.\nNowadays, researchers believe that ice crystals can partially melt, due to compression effects, as they pass through the engine fan section, enter the engine core and create a film of moisture on relatively warm surfaces, such as the forward stator vanes.\nThe moisture traps additional ice crystals, and, eventually, the ice buildup is shed into the compressor, causing the engine to surge and stall and possibly the combustor, causing a flameout.\nAnother possible cue to the presence of a high concentration of ice crystals at altitude is anomalous total air temperature (TAT) indications, which include the increase in outside static air temperature due to compression.\nResearchers believe that erratic and erraneously warm TAT indications are caused by ice crystals that build up on heated TAT probes and block the airflow through the probes.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of\nIndia\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nNote: We think this question is very tough, and whilst it is answerable with the knowledge required for the ATPLs, it requires different sections of knwoledge, and for them to be put together in the correct way. It is also very much an ATPL question only, as it refers specifically to what we are supposed to know about meteorology, and does not include any further knowledge. Please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and what you remember from it, so we can verify the question and options, thank you!\nThere are a few different bits of knowledge that you need here. Firstly, you must understand the global circulation pattern of air around the Earth. Things such as; where is a consistent high pressure surface zone, the ITCZ, ascending and subsiding air zones, and particularly\ntravelling lows\n. Then you must understand how the jet streams are formed based on that global circulation. Finally, you must understand\nhow jet streams are affected by (and affect) the surface weather conditions\n, and then you have to link all that information together.\nWhen you do, you find that\nthe correct answer is the\npolar jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere.\nSome people will be happy to leave it at that, and know the answer, but for those of you who want to know why, see the explanation below. It will have to skip over lots of details, as there are a lot of topics to link together here and this explanation could get huge if everything were to be explained in full.\nAssuming you know about the global circulation pattern of air, you will know that the polar front (between the Ferrel cell and polar cell of the atmosphere) creates \"\ntravelling lows\n\", also known as\npolar front depressions\n. For the purposes of the exams, these form somewhat consistently over the oceans; for us in Europe, we see the ones flowing from the Atlantic.\nThere are a few different jet streams that form over the Earth. There are the subtropical jet stream over the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, which is quite consistent, as well as the\npolar jet stream\n, also in both hemispheres and relatively consistent through the seasons. There is an arctic jet stream that forms over the pole which is in its winter (polar night - extremely cold). There is also a jet stream which flows the opposite way to the others (it is Easterly rather than the usual Westerlies) which is the equatorial jet stream, forming around June-August.\nThe jet streams have a large effect on the surface weather\n, particularly that beneath them, and\nthis relationship goes both ways\n, with the\nsurface pressure patterns and surface temperature very much affecting the jet stream's flow, speed and direction\n.\nIn particular, the jet stream we must know most about is the\npolar jet stream\n, and this is the one that sits above (not directly above - but close to) the\nsurface level travelling lows on the polar front\n.\nEach travelling low causes\nthe polar jet stream to bend\n, as the polar front is bent as part of the frontogenesis cycle\n.\nThis is what the question is asking\n.\nThe other jet streams are not bent as strongly or as often as the polar jet stream, due to their different circulation patterns\n.\nThankfully, it is not asked in this question, but between the Northern Hemisphere polar jet stream and the Southern Hemisphere polar jet stream, we would say that they both bend significantly, but the much greater amount of landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere create a more \"unstable\" jet stream, in that has much less regular movements, whereas the Southern Hemisphere has a lot less land to interfere with the jet stream. Travelling lows still form in the Southern Hemisphere, but have a more regular pattern.",

Dictated what size of super-cooled water droplets will be present in a given cloud and also in what quantity.\nIn this case\n, it is true that Stratocumulus clouds primarily contain small sized water droplets. However, bear in mind that temperature is very important. Temperatures at the surface are quite cold in this case (close to 0 \u00b0C). The cloud top will typically exhibit the coldest temperatures in these clouds. When the temperature is just right, these harmless-looking clouds can surprise a pilot with some moderate or even severe icing while climbing or descending through them \u2013 especially at the top of the cloud where the concentration of super-cooled water droplets will be higher. The higher the concentration of super-cooled water droplets, the greater the intensity of icing.

This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere,\nreflected off clouds back into space\n, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or\nabsorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed).\nThis heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength)\ninfrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection.\nThe clouds then have an effect on the outgoing infrared radiation, by\nabsorbing this radiation, and re-radiating it back down\n, creating\na blanket\naround that section of the Earth.\nThis is where a disagreement may occur, as that could be considered to be the clouds \"reflecting\" the infrared radiation back down,\nbut in reality, they primarily\nabsorb the infrared\n, and re-radiate it in all directions.\nSUMMARY\nThe clouds\nreflect UV rays\nback into space\nThe clouds\nabsorb and re-radiate\nthe infrared radiation from the Earth's surface.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. R\nesearch has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards.\nWarm anticyclones\n(so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.\nThe warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.\nPressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>\nIsobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels.\nFurthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (upwind side of the mountain, in this case, the south), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates.\nAfter saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes\n. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nWith regards to this question\n,\nwith a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds.\nThe north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer => little or no precipitation is expected.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nIce crystal icing\n(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology).\nIn many incidents, a recurring pattern involves the initial\naccumulation and formation of ice crystals on relatively warmer surfaces near the front of an engine\n. Subsequently, these crystals detach and\npartially melt as they pass through the engine core\n. This process can lead to uncommanded thrust reduction and potentially\ncause engine damage\n. An indication that a significant encounter with ice crystal icing (ICI) is occurring is typically observed through a gradual decrease in engine rpm and a simultaneous increase in Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT).\nTo mitigate the risk of encountering high concentrations of very small ice crystals, it is advisable to effectively utilize the aircraft weather radar. This entails using the radar to identify significant convective activity below the flight path and ensuring that those areas are avoided.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA\nradiation inversion\noccurs on\ncold winter nights characterized by clear skies and minimal to no wind\n. In such conditions, the dry air above the surface allows long-wave radiation to escape from the atmosphere during the night, a phenomenon known as nocturnal radiation. As a result, both the surface and the adjacent air cool down. This atmospheric setup can result in the development of ground-level fog. However, the presence of clouds can impede or entirely halt this cooling process.\nDesert air\n, characterized by its extreme dryness, is prone to the formation of radiation inversions on almost any summer night. In the daytime, the sun intensely warms the ground and the adjacent atmosphere. However, as evening descends and the sun disappears below the horizon, the primary heat source vanishes. In response, the\ndesert's sand rapidly releases its stored heat and undergoes a rapid cooling process\n. This immediate cooling effect extends to the air just above the surface, resulting in air temperatures near the ground dropping by as much as 15\u00baC within a matter of hours.\nThis phenomenon of cold surfaces and warmer upper air layers constitutes what is known as a temperature inversion\n. It's important to note that water, with its superior heat-retaining properties compared to rock and sand, is notably absent in the desert environment. Consequently, in the absence of cloud cover and with minimal water vapor, there is no thermal insulation to prevent the rapid cooling of the desert environment and strong inversions will commonly form.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nA synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area.\nPressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force.\nThe coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means\nthat air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force.\nThis makes it\nvery difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving\n. There is, however,\nsome air that manages to escape a high pressure zone\n, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This\nmostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more\n.\nThe outflow of air from a high is called divergence\n. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days.\nThe inflow of air into a low is called convergence\n. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather.\nIn this question, they are asking about\nthe atmospheric divergence from a high pressure zone\n. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel\nacross the isobars\nand\naway from the high pressure area\n,\ntowards the low.",

Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the formation of cloud. This will be the height of the base of the cloud.\nWith surface temperature and dew point => we can estimate the height of cloud base.\nCloud base = (surface temperature \u2013 surface dew point) x 400\nConsidering the above,\nwe can say that the height of the condensation level can be determined from the surface temperature and dew point.\nIf the dew point is significantly lower than temperature => condensation level is at a higher altitude.\nOn the other hand, if the difference between the surface temperature and the surface dew point is not significant => condensation level will be at lower altitude.",

A short line indicates 5 knots, long lines are 10 knots each, and a \"flag\" is 50 knots, they are cumulative.\nIt is also very important in this question to use the\nlocal true north\nwhen determining the wind direction. As the wind barbs highlighted are all of similar direction and the same strength, we do not have to do much interpolation to figure out a wind velocity reading. In the above annex, you can see the location of\nTrue North in line with the nearby meridians\n, as well as the green arrow aligned with the wind barbs, showing the direction.

The ITCZ is an area of low pressure due to the intense heating, and therefore\nthe surface wind flows towards it\n. This pulls warm water out of the Indian Ocean, turning into humid, unstable air masses over the hot Indian land mass, and can form into some\nvery large and violent thunderstorms across India\n. These bring\nhuge amounts of rainfall\n, and hence,\nthe SW monsoon season is very much classed as the rainy season.\nThe NE monsoon occurs at the opposite time of year, from October to December, when the ITCZ has gone to the South, now firmly within the Indian Ocean. This low pressure surface zone attracts the wind from all directions, meaning that much cooler, drier air flows over India from the North and North-East, then out towards the Indian Ocean.\nIf you can picture the movement of the ITCZ throughout the year and know that air flowing from ocean to land brings rain, these questions become simple, and the Indian monsoon seasons are easy to work out every time.\nOf course the answer here is the SW monsoon, and the months that best fit it are July to August.",

If temperature is colder than the ISA, then true altitude is lower than the indicated altitude.\nOn warm days the air expands and is less dense than on a cold day\n, and consequently raises the pressure levels. For example, the pressure level for 5 000 feet will be higher than on a day with standard conditions; the altimeter may indicate 5 000 feet when the airplane is actually at 6 000. One way to remember the effects of temperature in relation to true altitude is the mnemonic: \u201cFrom hot to cold, high to low (pressure), look out below.\u201d",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. Below, we will describe NE and SW Monsoon.\nNE MONSOON\n:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February\n, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over\ncentral India\n, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The\nSW Monsoon affects all of India\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.\nIn the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 240 ft, giving us a layer thickness of\n6 240\nft.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDefinitions\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Eventually the difference in speed might cause waves and, in some cases, distinctive clouds to form.\nJet streams can sometimes be identified by long streams of cirrus cloud formations. The turbulence associated with a jet stream can be very strong, and because it often occurs in clear air, it is difficult to forecast accurately.",

High-level cirriform clouds like cirrus (Ci), cirrostratus (Cs), or cirrocumulus (Cc) clouds have a low concentration of ice crystals and\ndo not pose a significant risk of icing\nor turbulence. Therefore, flying through cirriform clouds, as mentioned in the question, is not hazardous, and there is no need to activate the anti-icing systems.\nIt is important to note that the question specifically pertains to cirriform clouds.

This causes a change in wind direction - blows across the isobars towards the low pressure.\nAs we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the wind will back and slackens off as you descend to the surface due to the friction effect.\nIn other words, in the Northern hemisphere, frictional retardation causes veering of the airflow during climb out through the lower boundary layer (2000-3000 ft).\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the wind veers and slackens off as you descend to the surface.

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n=>\nOne such wind is the Chinook which blows on the eastern side of the Rocky mountains in Canada - usually blows during the winter months and produces a rapid and considerable rise in temperature.\nHow does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

It acts like a lid, keeping normal convective overturning of the atmosphere from penetrating through the inversion.\nSome of the effects it might have:\nAn inversion might cause clouds just below the inversion to spread out and take on a flattened appearance.\nStill another effect is to prevent thunderstorms from forming. Even in an air mass that is hot and humid in the lowest layers, thunderstorms will be prevented if an inversion in the lower atmosphere is keeping this air from rising. The conceptual opposite of a temperature inversion is an unstable air layer.",

There are currently two theories governing the formation of these precipitation drops:\nBERGERON THEORY.\nIt involves supercooled water droplets and explains how ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid cloud droplets within a mixed cloud.  There are more water molecules surrounding the water droplets than there are surrounding the ice crystals.  This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature.  Some of the water droplets will turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the temperature.\nUnlike the Bergeron Process, where precipitation forms under supercooled conditions, the\nCOALESCENCE PROCESS\ntypically occurs within relatively warm clouds with tops warmer than -15\u00baC. As you can tell by the name of this process, the collision of falling and rising droplets is what allows them to grow large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation.",

        "correct_answer": "Route 2: Keflavik - Brussels",
        "explanation": "The tropopause marks the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere and is where temperature ceases to fall with an increase in height. The height of the tropopause is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface. The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. Therefore, temperature variations due to latitude, season, land and sea, will all cause varying heights of the tropopause.\nAt the Equator, the average tropopause height ranges from 16 to 18 km, with temperatures averaging between -75\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C. Conversely, at the poles, the height is around 8 km, with average temperatures between -40\u00b0C and -50\u00b0C. Averaging at 50\u00b0N, the tropopause height is about 11 km (36 090 ft), accompanied by a temperature of approximately -56.5\u00b0C.\nWe would usually recommend that you choose the route with the largest variation in latitude (so an elongated North/South route, but in this case, the correct answer appears to be based on the temperature at FL240\nAs we have been given the temperatures at FL240 (\nremember they are all negative numbers\n), then we can say that\nthe greater the change in temp at FL240, the greater the change in tropopause height\n(it's a tiny bit of a stretch but still true in most cases), which allows us to answer the question.\nThe greatest change in temperature at FL240 is\nfrom Keflavik to Brussels, Route 2\n, where the temperature changes from around\n-42\u00baC to -28\u00baC\n. Each other route has a much smaller temperature change.",

        "explanation": "\u201cThe maximum water vapour pressure is higher over ice than over water with the same temperature\u201d\nINCORRECT\nThe vapor pressure - is the pressure exerted by the water vapor molecules in the air. As the number of water vapour molecules increases, the vapour pressure increases.\nIf heat is added and temperature increased, the molecules will have more internal energy and will start to move faster. Eventually, they will be able to break free and evaporate from the surface and the vapor pressure will increase => the saturation vapor pressure increases when the temperature increases.\nFor a liquid surface it will be much easier for water molecules to break free and evaporate than for a solid surface (ie. Ice). That is because the bonds between adjacent molecules are stronger in an ice surface than they are in a water surface. At the same temperature, fewer molecules will break free from an ice surface than from a water surface,\n=> Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure over liquid water.\n\u201cFor unsaturated air the dew-point temperature is lower than the temperature\u201d\nCORRECT\nDew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for\nsaturation to occur.\nWhen the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated.\nDew point temperature is NEVER GREATER than the air temperature.\nTherefore, if the air cools, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation.\nSummary:\nfor unsaturated air \u2013 dew point is lower than air temperature; and\nfor saturated air \u2013 dew point is equal to air temperature.",

The flight is performed maintaining a constant\nIndicated Altitude of 6 500 ft based on Point A's QNH of 1012 hPa\n(and that is all we need from Point A - elevation is irrelevant).\nIn order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way:\nIf we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 977 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure:\n1012 hPa - 977 hPa = 35 hPa\nAssume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft\n35 hPa x 27 ft =\n945 ft\nWhich means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction\nTA = 6500 ft - 945 ft = 5555 ft\nThe elevation at B is 930 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 5555 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 5555 ft - 930 ft =\n4625 ft\nNote: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude.\nIf QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.\nAlternatively, you can think of it this way:\n- You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 977 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 930 ft AMSL.\n- Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1012 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 930 ft + 945 ft = 1875 ft => however, we are still on the ground.\n- We will now climb to 6500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1012). We need to climb 6500 ft - 1875 ft = 4625 ft (which is our height over the surface).\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5\u00b0C.\nCalculating the average tropopause height (ft):\nTropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280\nfor winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result.\nLatitude is given by the question: 60\u00baN\nTropopause height = (16 x cos 60\u00ba) x 3280 = 26 240 ft\nOverhead the sea, it is usually warmer. Therefore, we would have to choose the next higher value.\nFrom available options, 20 000 ft would be too low.\nBest option: 29 000 ft.\nNote: the formula described in this explanation gives an approximate value. Normally around 60\u00ba latitudes tropopause is between 25 0000 and 30 000 ft .",

        "explanation": "Note: There are\n2 different questions being asked recently, which appear to feature 2 different types of frozen precipitation.\nOf course, we have not seen the exact images being used, so as yet we cannot perfectly identify what is being asked about. It is our belief that this question asked in this format has the answer of \"\nsoft hail/graupel\", which are abbreviated to GS, and come from CBs, which obviously contain moderate to severe turbulence\n. The precipitation is too large to be \"snow grains - SG\", which appears to be the answer to the corresponding question.\nFrozen precipitation can form in many different ways, and in fact, due to the height of clouds, a lot of the time, precipitation falls in frozen form and melts into regular rain on the way down.\nThe size and appearance of frozen precipitation dictates its designation. For instance, the type of precipitation dictated is called soft hail (or graupel), and comes from convective clouds, such as Cb (Cumulonimbus) and tCu (towering cumulus). They are smaller than hail, at\nunder 5 mm diameter\n, and are\nformed when snow falls, but collides with supercooled water droplets on the way down, forming a hybrid particle that freezes,\nforming\nsmall opaque balls\n. The process is remarkably similar to how airframes build up\nrime\nice, but on a much smaller scale.\nTo finish off the question, it is common to associate\nconvective clouds such as Cbs with moderate to severe turbulence.",

        "explanation": "NOTE: The feedback for this question is incomplete and we have had to fill in some gaps ourselves, so this may be different in the exam. Please send us any further exam feedback you have, thank you!\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a broad zone of air mass sometimes called the heat equator.\nHere, the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide. Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere.\nAs the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth\u2019s midsection. these convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear.\nThe ITCZ is a low pressure zone\n,\ndue to the intense heating of the local air from the hot ground/sea\n, leading to large updrafts of air, which can form very violent thunderstorms, climbing to altitudes of 55-60 000 ft at their highest.\nTherefore, it can be very dangerous to fly in the region of the ITCZ. Mostly, this is due to rapidly changing, unpredictable, violent weather conditions. For this question though, that is not part of any of the options. Instead, this question is asking about the dangers of the\nITCZ in terms of it being a low pressure area\n.\nA low pressure area can cause altimeters to overread\nif they are not set correctly. This sounds self-explanatory (\"Of course they don't work if you don't use them right!\"), but actually, it can lead to the aircraft being much lower than expected, either during times of rapid pressure changes, or when the\naircraft is flying on flight levels\n, and therefore using 1013 hPa. In\nhot and low pressure areas\n, the aircraft's true altitude could be many thousands of feet below what is showing on the altimeter (pressure altitude). This is\nparticularly dangerous around mountains, which this question mentions\n.",

It can occur when the\noutside air temperature is between -10\u00baC and +30\u00baC\nand with a high relative humidity.\nCarburettor icing is particularly common, as the air cools down significantly inside the carburettor, not only due to the decreased static pressure in the venturi section (decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the evaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air. It is worse when the throttle is low, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect.\nAs you can see by the graph above, the\nworst icing happens between about -1\u00baC and +15\u00b0C.",

This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere.\nMountain waves may also be referred to as standing waves or lee waves. These are likely to form when the following\natmospheric conditions are present\n:\nWind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band.\nWind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 20 knots, increasing with height.\nA marked layer of stability around the altitude of the summits, e.g. an isothermal layer or inversion, with less stable air above and below\nIf the wave amplitude is large enough, then the waves become unstable and break, similar to the breaking waves seen in the surf. Within these 'breaking waves', the atmospheric flow becomes turbulent. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 4,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors\nto form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.",

This uneven heating will cause variation in pressure between land and sea. Wind will, therefore, start blowing towards the lower pressure area => warmer area \u2013 FROM THE SEA TO LAND (Sea breeze).\nIn this case, when flying in the west coast, we will experience a wind blowing from the SEA to LAND.

        "explanation": "Under normal ISA conditions, warm air ascends until it reaches its condensation point, at which clouds form and the heat released during condensation continues to propel the upward movement of the air. Once all the moisture has condensed, cloud formation ceases.\nHowever, the presence of an inversion, often referred to as an isothermal layer, disrupts this upward motion. Inversions occur when the rising air encounters a layer of air that is warmer, causing it to halt its ascent. Consequently,\ninversions frequently cap clouds and fog layers\n. Moreover, an inversion inhibits the vertical movement of other atmospheric particles contained within the air pocket.\nAs a result,\nan area above an inversion layer typically remains clear of clouds\n, smog, mist, and haze, among other things. In addition, there is an increase in wind speed above the inversion compared to just below it, resulting in significant wind shear at the inversion layer.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nSubsidence inversions occur when high surface pressure is present. This brings divergence at the surface, causing the air column above the high pressure to subside. This air warms up at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) of 3\u00baC/1000ft, which means that the air quickly gets quite warm, often quite a bit warmer than the air near the ground. This temperature difference will eventually stop the air descending any further, and instead the air begins to spread outward in divergence, but\nwith a layer of cooler air trapped underneath this inversion that has formed\n. The inversion usually exists at around 2 - 3 000 ft, and can bring a reduction in visibility due to haze and other particles in the air under the inversion.\nTherefore, the location and time of year for this would be anywhere that gets high pressure systems.\nNorthern continents in Winter\n, such as Canada and Siberia tend to get v\nery cold, bringing high pressure\n, so these are correct.\nSubtropical ocean areas\ninclude the belt of\nsubtropical high pressure\n, so that is certainly correct. Therefore, this option is\ncorrect.\nThe Polar regions do have high pressure systems, but less so during the Summer than in the winter.\nThe Equatorial regions tend to have low pressure, due to the intense heating, and the location of the ITCZ (which is a product of this low pressure).\nMountainous regions have very varied weather, but you wouldn't expect high pressure for every mountainous region during every season, so incorrect.\nNote that the Encyclopedia Brittanica quotes the following \"Subsidence inversions are common over the\nnorthern continents in winter and over the subtropical oceans\n; these regions generally have subsiding air because they are located under large high-pressure centres.\", so we can see where the question writer got this from.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nHUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.\nHumidity Measurement\nAbsolute Humidity\nRefers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3\nSaturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)\nMaximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.\nHumidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)\nThe ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.\nExpressed as g/kg of dry air.\nRelative Humidity (RH)\nThe ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.\nDepends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.\nRH = (HMR/SMR) x 100\nRH 100% = Saturation\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.\nFrom the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.\nRelative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too.\nAs air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases.\nOn the other hand, since colder air doesn\u2019t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.",

Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers).\nIn terms of this question, the\nrunway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of\ncentreline markings or lights\nthat can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so the answer \"identify the runway centre line\" must be correct.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA TORNADO is a violently rotating column of air that\nextends from a thunderstorm to the ground\n. It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction. It creates a very small (a few hundred meters maximum), extremely low pressure zone, with air circulating around it at incredibly high speeds, in the region of 200 kt.\nTornadoes start as funnel clouds\n, extending downwards from the base of the thunderstorm, eventually reaching the ground and causing incredible destruction in some cases. The cores only move at around 10-20kt, but the wind speed around the core can reach over 200 kt.\nTo address the other answers, a cyclone is a tropical revolving storm around the Indian Ocean, a dust devil is a small dry, tornado style wind event without a cloud, which picks up the nearby dust into a swirl, and looks like a little whirlpool of air. Dust devils can, in very rare circumstances, become bigger than a few metres wide, and look like a little tornado without a cloud.",

Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows: Correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (+15) \u00d7 (12 000/1 000) =\n720 ft\n.\nYou have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL110 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL110). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.\nIn the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 720 ft, giving us a layer thickness of\n12 720\nft.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDefinitions\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Primarily, insolation can be considered the process via which the atmosphere is heated. The wavelength of radiated energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of whatever is emitting it. As the Sun is very hot, its radiations are of shorter wavelength than those from the Earth.\n\u201cThe Earth only radiates heat into space between sunset and sunrise.\u201d\nIncorrect\nThe Earth receives a large amount of energy from the Sun. and it is this energy that results in a warm, livable planet. However, only a certain amount of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and used to heat the Earth. About 70% is absorbed by the planet, and the remaining 30% is reflected back to space by various surfaces such as clouds, ice, and deserts. The Earth is constantly absorbing and radiating energy.\n\u201cCloud cover has NO effect on the amount of the Sun's radiated heat arriving at the Earth's surface.\u201d\nIncorrect\n.\nLow, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth.\nCorrect\n.\n\u201cMore heat is radiated into space from a warm surface than from a cold surface.\u201d\nThe temperature of an object dictates how quickly they will lose energy to their surroundings. Hotter objects emit more radiation than colder objects, and thus a hotter planet will shed more energy to space than a colder planet.",

It can subject your airplane to sudden updrafts, downdrafts or extreme horizontal wind components, causing loss of lift or violent changes in vertical speeds or altitudes.\nWe emphasise the significance of low level wind shear, which is hazardous for aircraft during take-off and landing. Sudden changes in the direction and speed of the air flow may cause a loss of altitude, and being too close to ground, the altitude will not be enough for correction. This situation may suddenly change the flight circumstances so much that the pilot may lose control over the aircraft.\nWhen wind shear is reported, the wisest solution is to not start the approach.\nThe pilot should delay the approach (i.e. request holding) if enough fuel is available or simply divert if these conditions are persistent.",

        "explanation": "Saturation occurs when the air reaches its maximum capacity to hold water vapour\nat a specific temperature and pressure. The process that leads to saturation is influenced by various factors, but in this context, we'll focus on the options provided.\na) \"Increasing the air pressure\":\nINCORRECT\n. While increasing air pressure can impact the air's capacity to hold water vapour, it does not directly lead to saturation. Higher pressure allows the air to hold more water vapour.\nb) \"Increasing the amount of water vapor in the air\": This is the\nCORRECT\nanswer. When more water vapour is introduced into the air, it increases the humidity level. As the air accumulates water vapour, it approaches its saturation point. Once the air reaches this saturation point, further additions of water vapour will lead to condensation, forming clouds or precipitation.\nc) \"Increasing the temperature of the air\":\nINCORRECT\n. Raising the air temperature does not directly cause the air to become saturated. However, it is an essential factor in determining the air's capacity to hold water vapour. Warm air can accommodate more water vapour than cold air. As the temperature increases, the air can hold more moisture, thus reducing relative humidity - making saturation less likely.\nd) \"Decreasing the amount of water vapour in the air\":\nINCORRECT\n. Lowering the amount of water vapour in the air reduces the humidity level, making saturation less likely. The air becomes drier, it does not cause the air to become saturated.\nAIR BECOMES SATURATED:\nBy adding more water vapour to it.\nAs warm air can hold more water vapour than cold, saturation can be achieved by cooling\nthe air (adiabatic cooling = adiabatic expansion = lifting the parcel to a higher level).\nCombination of both of the above.",

Where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude (in the troposphere), then we have what is called an inversion.\nWe can think of an inversion as a \"Tupperware lid\" for the atmosphere - it limits the upward movement of air from lower parts of the atmosphere (inhbits vertical mixing). Consequently, air pollutants, smoke, and dust aren't able to be dispersed throughout the atmosphere. This accumulation of particulates can cause reduced visibility below the inversion.\nWith regards to this question\n, as we have discussed, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height =>\nThrust and lift will decrease as the aircraft climbs into warmer and less dense air.\nAir pollutants, smoke, and dust will not disperse vertically, instead they are trapped below the inversion - resulting in a deteriorated visibility =>\nTherefore, visibility improves above the inversion.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nWith regards to this question,\nwith a westerly wind - the west side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds.\nThe east side (where the aerodrome is located) is the leeward/downwind side\n, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer (\nFoehn wind\n).",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nAircraft icing can be divided into two general types based on whether it affects power production or aerodynamics. Induction icing affects engine power and includes when ice forms in the carburettor venturi. It can occur when the\noutside air temperature is between -10\u00baC and +30\u00baC and with a high relative humidity.\nCarburettor icing is particularly common, as the\nair cools down significantly inside the carburettor\n, not only due to the\ndecreased static pressure in the venturi section\n(decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the\nevaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor\n, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air.\nIt is worse when the throttle is low\n, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect.\nAs you can see by the graph above, the\nworst icing happens between about -1\u00baC and +15\u00b0C,\nwhich is very close to the correct answer given here.\nToo warm, and the air won't cool down enough in the carburettor to form ice. Too cold, and there isn't usually enough water vapour in the air to develop carburettor icing.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at\n8 000 ft\n.\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nTo compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad-5 \u00baC. The actual temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-24\u00baC, which is an ISA deviation of\nISA -19\u00baC\n.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -19\u00baC\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-19) \u00d7 (8 000/1000) =\n-608 ft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded\nto the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad8 608\nft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa =\n23 hPa\n. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:\nPressure correction\n= 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =\n621 ft\n. This value needs to be\nadded\nto the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 8 608 ft + 621 ft =\n9 229 ft\n.\nAs flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 9 229 ft, which is\nFL100\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

It can be caused by\nvertical movement of air \"pockets\"\n, through either convective or mechanical means, or can be caused by a sudden change in horizontal wind speed, called\nwindshear\n.\nConvective turbulence occurs due to either\ninstability in the air\ncausing vertical air movement (cumulus type clouds show this effect) or by\nthermal heating\nof the ground. The Earth's surface is made up of different materials, and these absorb and radiate heat energy at different rates, that means that an airport (lots of tarmac or concrete) may create a much warmer pocket of air than a grassy meadow, for instance, and this will cause a significant difference in air movement between the two.\nMechanical turbulence is caused due to undulations and objects on the Earth's surface.\nBuildings, trees, hills and mountains can change the pattern of the wind\n, and cause\neddy currents\nof wind in the air close to the ground. This can cause a lot of turbulence at lower levels, such as after take-off or on the approach. Orographic turbulence is another name for this, but is more specific to the turbulence caused by hills, mountains, etc.\nThe time of\nworst turbulence during the day is usually\nearly to mid-afternoon\n, where\nthe ground is radiating the most heat\n, and therefore the pockets of air are at their most different to each other, causing the most turbulence.\nHigher winds also contribute to more mechanical turbulence, especially when the\nterrain is rough\nand there are\nplenty of obstacles\nfor the wind to hit\n.",

Stable conditions mean that air which is forced to rise is colder than the air around it, and will sink again when the rising force ceases.

This can leads to\nstrong turbulence effects from mountain rotors and strong downdrafts on the lee-side of the mountain\n. Therefore, in stable conditions,\nthe most turbulence will be found when downwind of a mountain or mountain range\n. In strong enough winds, stable air conditions can lead to mountain waves forming downwind of the mountain/mountain range which triggers them, and they are incredibly turbulent areas, with significant updrafts and downdrafts.\nIn this case, the wind direction for the airport to be\ndownwind\nof the mountain is from anywhere\nbetween about 040\u00ba and 100\u00ba\n, as the contour chart appears to show a bit of a mountain ridge line.

        "explanation": "An aircraft's barometric altimeter does not actually measure height difference between the aircraft and sea level, it is simply a barometer, and measures static air pressure, which is shown as an altitude readout. in comparison to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)\nThe altitude shown by a barometric altitude with QNH pressure set is the \"indicated altitude\". It varies from true altitude by a difference in temperature from ISA, and varies from pressure altitude (flight levels) due to a difference in pressure setting between QNH and standard pressure setting (1013.25 hPa).\nIf the QNH pressure is set, and\nthe pressure changes but the pilot does not change the altimeter subscale\n, then\nthe aircraft's true altitude will change without the pilot noticing\n. This is the same for temperature changes. The rule for\nboth pressure and temperature changes\nis:\nHigh to Low, Beware Below.\nThis means that any decrease in pressure or temperature will cause our true altitude to decrease, and vice-versa.\nSo in this scenario,\nthe static pressure decreasing\nwould cause our\ntrue altitude to decrease without the altimeter needle moving\n. The radio altimeter is not affected by such errors though, and will be a very useful indication of our true altitude, especially whilst flying over the sea. A decreasing radio altimeter indication therefore means that\neither the radio altimeter is broken, or the pressure is decreasing\n. On the balance of probabilities, it is\nmuch more likely that the pressure is decreasing.",

        "correct_answer": "Predominantly in the middle section of the CB.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nAirframe icing is a huge hazard to flight. In icing conditions, pilots have to be very careful. Not only does ice accretion\nadd weight and drag\nto an aircraft, it also\nchanges the shape of the wing, reducing the finely tuned lift characteristics.\nIt can also block probes and ice over ports or vanes. Airframe icing happens primarily whilst flying in an area with an\nair temperature just below 0\u00baC\n, and therefore with an airframe below freezing temperature. Clouds can often contain droplets of water that are below freezing temperature (0\u00baC), but are still in liquid form.\nThese are called Super-Cooled Water Droplets (SCWDs)\n. As soon as SCWDs hit a freezing airframe, they will freeze onto it.\nThis freezing can take place a bit differently depending on the droplet size and temperature. If the droplets are large, and quite close to the freezing point, then they will release enough latent heat as they freeze, that the rest of the droplet will drip backwards over the wing and form clear ice. This is usually regarded as the most dangerous type of ice. The freezing can also happen immediately (particularly for smaller droplets at lower temperatures), and they form a white build-up on the leading edge of the wings and other surfaces, called rime ice.\nThe worst icing happens just below 0\u00baC, and icing can occur down to temperatures as cold as -45\u00baC, but it is a gradual drop off, and you would not expect any significantly dangerous ice below -23\u00baC. The SCWDs rarely get much colder than this before freezing in the cloud.\nConvective clouds such as CBs are the worst for icing\n, as they can hold large droplets using their strong updrafts, and have wild temperature changes allowing large SCWDs into colder sections where an airframe would be very prone to icing. Nimbostratus clouds can also hold medium sized droplets and produce moderate icing.\nInside a CB cloud, the worst icing is going to be just above the freezing level, which is\nusually around the middle of the cloud\n. At the bottom of the cloud, the temperature is above freezing, and at the top of the cloud, it is mostly just ice crystals and hail that has been thrown up there.",

Once it starts climbing it will pass through the\ntransition altitude.\nHere the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa.\nSo, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting.\nYou would now speak of\nflight level\n; the transition levels can be found on SID plates.\nThis is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure.\nThis is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don\u2019t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft.\nIf we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the\ntransition level\n(this is the lowest flight level\nabove\nthe transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS.\nA transition layer\nis the space between the transition altitude and transition level.\nIf you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting.\nWhen an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer.\nIn the case of this specific question:\nThe question states the aircraft is descending so the altimeter will be reset at the transition level.\nBecause the local QNH is 1009 (you came from a standard setting of 1013,25) you go from a higher pressure to a lower one.\nThis means that the altitude shown on the altimeter will decrease.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nStructural Icing\nIt builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.\nThere are 2 general types of structural icing:\nRIME ICE\nNormally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -10\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nA hard and heavy layer of transparent ice is formed that spreads from the point of impact to areas further away on the structure. It may be difficult or sometimes impossible to completely remove this ice accretion using the aircraft de-icing equipment.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -10\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCOLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL\nA cold pool, often referred to as Cold Air Drop, is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - i\nt\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air\nin the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nAs a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCold-air drops, also known as cold pools, have the potential to form in various locations and during any season, but they are commonly associated with\npolar front depression systems\n.\nIt's important to note that the formation of a cut-off low and the cold pool is not directly caused by the convection of cold air in a trough with stable air.",

Haze is primarily caused by particles in the atmosphere which\nscatter the light.\nThe increase in airborne particulates combined with\nlow sun angles\ncauses the slant range visibility to be reduced even further.\nAn aircraft landing \"into the sun\" will experience significant haze related visibility degradation =>\nin this case, greatest visibility deterioration will occur when landing on runways close to a bearing of 270\u00ba - into the sunset.\nRunway 25\nis very close to this, so would experience the same effect.\nIf the visibility in any direction is below 1500m or half of the reported prevailing visibility, then it will be reported as a minimum visibility and its direction\n. As this has\nnot been reported\n, we know the visibility in the landing direction should\nnot be below 1 500 m.\nIt will be below 3 000 m though, due to the aircraft landing towards the setting sun.\nNote\n: This is a very common type of question to encounter, but the examiner will sometimes change the values used, so read the question and options fully before answering.",

        "correct_answer": "(1) higher; (2) lower.",
        "explanation": "There is a temperature which, if a parcel of air cools down to it, the relative humidity will reach 100%, causing the water to begin to condense into droplets\n(or freeze into ice crystals if cold enough).\nThis temperature is called the dew point.\nIn this question,\nthe\nrelative humidity\nat the cloud base will obviously be\nhigher\nthan at the ground\n, as the air is colder at height (unstable atmosphere means no inversion, and cumulus clouds would not begin to form otherwise). In fact, the relative humidity at the cloud base should be exactly 100%, as this is why the cloud is now forming in any air currents that have risen.\nThe dew point is slightly more complicated. It actually decreases slightly with altitude due to the decreasing pressure (and therefore postpones the saturation of the air mass a little at higher altitudes). Therefore\nthe\ndew point\nat the cloud base will be\nlower\nthan at the ground.\nFurther information:\nA parcel of air can hold a certain amount of water in vapour form. That amount depends on the temperature of the parcel of air. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than colder air. When a parcel of air becomes overfilled with water vapour,\nthe excess water will begin to\ncondense\ninto water droplets\n, which forms clouds, fog and dew. This most often occurs because the air parcel cools down for some reason, and therefore can no longer hold the water vapour that was already inside it, and as it cools, more and more water is released to condense into droplets.\nA parcel of air's water vapour content is its absolute humidity (the actual amount of water vapour present). A more useful metric is its\nrelative humidity\nthough, and this is its\nwater vapour content\n, as\na\npercentage of its maximum (saturated)\nwater vapour content.\nWhen a parcel of air cools down without adding or losing water vapour, its relative humidity increases, because the colder air has a lower maximum humidity (saturation point). When the relative humidity of an air parcel reaches 100%, the air is saturated, and the water begins to condense into droplets if any further water is added, or any cooling occurs.",

There are currently two theories governing the formation of these precipitation drops:\nBERGERON THEORY.\nIt involves supercooled water droplets and explains how ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid cloud droplets within a mixed cloud. There are more water molecules surrounding the water droplets than there are surrounding the ice crystals. This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature. Some of the water droplets will turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the temperature.\nUnlike the Bergeron Process, where precipitation forms under supercooled conditions, the\nCOALESCENCE PROCESS\ntypically occurs within relatively warm clouds with tops warmer than -15\u00baC. As you can tell by the name of this process, the collision of falling and rising droplets is what allows them to grow large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation.\nIn mid-latitudes this process produces only drizzle or very light rain.\nBecause the extension of warmer clouds is less in mid-latitudes in addition to convective currents and air friction disintegrates large droplets.",

The figures next to the wind barbs represent the forecasted temperature at that point and altitude.\nTo determine the ISA temperature deviation at FL110 and FL180, in order to calculate the ISA deviation at FL150, we need to first calculate the ISA temperature at these levels:\nAt FL110\n: ISA temperature = 15 - 2 x 11 = -7\u00baC\nAt FL180\n: ISA temperature = 15 - 2 x 18 = -21\u00baC\nThe actual temperature at FL110 is +9\u00baC, which means it is\n16\u00baC warmer\nthan the ISA temperature.\nThe actual temperature at FL180 is -9\u00baC, indicating it is\n12\u00baC warmer\nthan the ISA temperature.\nBased on the calculations, the ISA deviation falls approximately between ISA+12\u00baC and ISA+16\u00baC.

There is also a Nimbostratus cloud at 3500 ft - which usually produces continuous rain, snow.\nAssuming that rain falls from NS clouds - generally, precipitation first falls as snow. When falling through warmer air before reaching the ground (in this case, due to the temperature inversion, temperature at 3500 ft will be above 0\u00baC), it melts and turns to rain droplets. It then falls through cold air again before hitting the aircraft surface (at 2000 ft, temperature = -2\u00baC), the droplets become supercooled. In simple words, due to the temperature inversion,\nthe rain falls from the warmer air (above 0\u00b0C at 3500 ft) into the cold air (below 0\u00b0C at 2000 ft) => forming freezing rain.\n\"Windshear\"\nINCORRECT\n. if you take a look at the wind, it is pretty stable/not very strong => 02 340\u00ba/10; 05 330\u00ba/15",

Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off\n. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be\ndownwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud\n- the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.\nIn the case of this question\n,\nthe first part of the route including the initial climb is completely clear of large convective active such as CBs.\nHowever, for the last hundreds of NM or so, the aircraft is cruising at FL370/FL490 completely within a region of OCNL EMBD CBs with tops of FL500.\nThis area would be a perfect place for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture\ncarried up to the high altitudes.\nNote: The total distance from Bangkok to Manila is roughly 1200 NM.",

Approximately half of the total radiation reaches, and is absorbed by, the Earth\u2019s surface with the rest being absorbed by the atmosphere or re-radiated into space by scattering and reflection.\nTerrestrial Radiation\nThe Earth radiates energy into the atmosphere in the form of terrestrial radiation.\nIt is more readily absorbed by the atmosphere especially by clouds, water vapour and carbon dioxide that solar radiation due to its longer wavelength\n. The absorption of heat by the atmosphere from the Earth is the main heat exchange mechanism that causes weather. Any terrestrial radiation not absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere escapes back into space.\nSUMMARY\nInsolation\n: sun warms the Earth;\nRadiation\n: Earth loses heat, radiates heat.\nDuring the day, insolation predominates over radiation; hence Earth gets warmer. At night, radiation predominates; Earth cools down. On the average, however, (within a year) insolation and radiation are approximately in balance but it fluctuates during a year (seasonal).",

In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +20\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (+20) \u00d7 (3 000/1000) =\n240 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n3 240\nf\nt\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nAn occluded front is formed when a cold front and a warm front merge together. Usually, a cold front will catch up with the preceding warm front, and the warm sector of air will be trapped, and lifted up from the surface.\nAn occlusion usually takes on the form of both fronts in quick succession, and the weather in the central part of the occlusion will be decided by the type of occlusion, warm or cold.\nThe type of occlusion is simply which front stays connected to the ground. If the warm front remains intact, and the cold front \"rides\" up it, then the warm front is still touching the ground, and it is a warm occlusion. The frontal weather acts more like a warm front in this case, and the majority of the rain occurs before the front hits, and\nthe weather will gradually clear\nafter the surface front has passed.\nOn the other hand, if\nthe cold front forces the warm front up\n, then the occlusion is a\ncold occlusion\n. This acts more like a cold front, and\nthe majority of the rain falls just after the surface front has passed.\nThe type of occlusion depends on which sector of air is coldest\n. Of course, the warmest sector is forced upwards in between two colder sectors of air. If the back sector is coldest, then it will be a cold occlusion. If the front section is the coldest, then the back section will be comparatively warm, and a warm occlusion will form.\nIn Europe, we usually see cold occlusions in Summer\nand\nwarm occlusions in Winter\n(the opposite temperature of the season). This is because the winds into Western Europe are from the Atlantic and,\nin Summer\n,\nthe ground is warmer than the water, so the front sector (which has already reached ground) is warmer than the back sector (still over water)\n, and therefore\na cold occlusion is most common.",

The aircraft is most likely climbing after take off or approaching to land when passing through the inversion, which means that the airspeed is most probably slow - only a few knots greater than stall speed. The fluctuation in airspeed can induce a stall precariously close to the ground.\nSince surface wind is calm or very light, take off or landing can be in any direction.\nTakeoff may be in the direction of the wind above the inversion. If so, the aircraft encounters a sudden tailwind and a corresponding loss of airspeed when climbing through the inversion. Stall is possible.\nIf approach is into the wind above the inversion, the headwind is suddenly lost when descending through the inversion. Again, a sudden loss in airspeed may induce a stall.",

        "explanation": "The stratosphere, which is the second major level of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, is just above the troposphere and below the mesosphere.\nWhether an aircraft flies in the stratosphere or not largely depends on the type of aircraft. Some airplanes, such as commercial jets, are better suited to flying at higher altitudes and it is also more advantageous for them to do so. Some of the reasons why it is advantageous for aeroplanes to fly in the lower stratosphere are listed below.\nFUEL ECONOMY\n.  At around 35 000 - 42 000 feet, which is the altitude that commercial airliners like to operate in, a very low amount of oxygen is required for proper combustion in the jet engines. An airplane flying in the stratosphere uses far less fuel than at lower altitudes thanks to the lower air density and lower temperature.\nThe air temperature drops 2\u00b0C for every 1 000 feet an airplane climbs \u2013 up to about 36 000 feet. This results in big savings for the airline and other operators.\nLESS TURBULENCE\n. Generally speaking, much of the weather phenomenon we see on Earth occurs in the troposphere, therefore an airplane flying in the stratosphere can avoid the bad weather that is typically found lower in the atmosphere. If you\u2019ve wondered why you don\u2019t see any clouds in the stratosphere it\u2019s because the air contains very little water vapor, so clouds are unable to form.\nTIME EFFICIENT\n. At higher altitudes, the air is thinner (roughly thousands of times thinner at the top of the stratosphere compared to at sea level), which results in less drag. An airplane flying in the stratosphere can therefore\n, fly faster and a pilot will reach their destination more quickly.",

        "explanation": "In the real atmosphere the tropopause is a continuous surface\n.\nINCORRECT\n.\nThe tropopause is not always one continuous surface\n. Often there is a distinct tropopause above the tropics with a break at around 30\u00b0 latitude where a new tropopause forms at a lower level. That tropopause slopes downward toward the pole and sometimes shows another break. A jet stream is often found in these tropopause breaks, which become regions of mixing between troposphere and stratosphere.\nThe height of the tropopause in the ISA is 11 km\n.\nCORRECT\n.\nThe tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator\n. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet\n(approx. 11 km).\nYou can easily calculate it as follows:\nT\no find ISA standard temperature for a given altitude, here's a rule of thumb: double the altitude, subtract 15 and place a - sign in front of it.\n=>\n(For example, to find ISA Temp at 10,000 feet, we multiply the altitude by 2 to get 20; we then subtract 15 to get 5; finally, we add a - sign to get -5.)\nISA Tropopause temperature = -56.5\u00baC\n15\u00baC \u2013 2\u00baC x Y = -56.5\u00baC\nY = (-56.5\u00baC \u2013 15\u00baC) / 2\nY = approx. 36\nWhich means 36000 ft.

Each FL corresponds to a specific pressure surface (pressure value):\nFL50 = 850 hPa\nFL100 = 700 hPa\nFL140 = 600 hPa\nFL180 = 500 hPa\nFL240 = 400 hPa\nFL300 = 300 hPa\nFL340 = 250 hPa\nFL390 = 200 hPa\nFL450 = 150 hPa\nIn the ISA atmosphere, the pressure decreases at the following rates:\nMSL 1 hPa = 27 ft (8 m)\n18 000 ft (5 500 m) 1 hPa = 50 ft (15 m)\n39 000 ft (12 000 m) 1 hPa = 105 ft (32 m)\n52 500 ft (16 000 m) 1 hPa = 210 ft (64 m)\nAlternatively, you can use the following formula:\nThe formula to calculate the change in ft/hPa = 96 x T/P\n- Where \"T\" stands for temperatura in K, and \"P\" is pressure.\nIn this case, we will have ISA temperature at FL180 = 15 - 2 x 18 = -21\u00baC\nK = C + 273; K = -21\u00baC + 273 = 252 K\nChange in ft/hPa = 96 x 252/500 = 48 approx.\nNote that the formula above only gives an approximate result - which is close enough to answer this sort of questions and it is valid for ISA temperatures only. i.e. for a cold air, the pressure will fall more rapidly with altitude - and the distance between the molecules is less than in warm air.",

Can be defined as warm air replacing cold air.\nThe warm, less dense air is overtaking/displacing the cold air => warm air will ride up and over the denser cold air while advancing.

The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to 2/3 of the geostrophic interval measured along the front.\nThe warm air is mostly stable, the clouds that form are mostly stratiform.\nAs the warm front approaches, we typically see this sequence of clouds: Cl, CS, AS, NS.\nFlying towards the west, the pilot will observe the following sequence of clouds:\nCirrus CI:\nat FL250-350 as far as 600 NM (1100 km) ahead of the front.\nCirrostratus CS:\nat FL200-250 gradually replace the Cl (about 800 km from the surface front)\nAltostratus AS\n: at FL150-200 as the front gets closer.\nNimbostratus NS\n: between 6000 - 8000 ft, approx. 150-200 NM (270- 370 km)away (in some cases up to 300 NM) until the front.\nStratus ST or Stratocumulus SC: can be encountered below the NS\nFrontal FOG can sometimes be encountered 20-50 NM ahead of the frontal ground surface.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFOEHN EFFECT\nFoehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges\n(warm katabatic wind)\n.\nThis is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. Next, we will explore NE and SW Monsoons.\nNE MONSOON\n:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February\n, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has\na long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms\n, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The\nSW Monsoon affects all of India\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore,\npressure correction is disregarded\n.\nTo determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL390). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at FL390 is -56.5\u00baC (since it is below ISA tropopause). The actual outside air temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-48 \u00baC, which means we have an ISA deviation of\nISA +8.5\u00baC\n.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +8.5\u00baC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (8.5) \u00d7 (34 000/1000) =\n1 156 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is added the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad40 156 ft\n.\nTherefore, the height above ground = 40 156 ft - 29 029 ft =\n11 127 ft\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nClear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil.

Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected.\nSeveral engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions\n. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces\nbecause the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.\nMountain waves can cause:\nLoss of Control.\nThe vertical currents in the waves can make it difficult for an aircraft to maintain en route altitude leading to level busts and can cause significant fluctuations in airspeed potentially leading to loss of control\n. Loss of Control can also occur near to the ground prior to landing or after take off with a risk of terrain contact or a hard landing if crew corrective response to a downdraft is not prompt.\nTurbulence\n.\nAircraft can suffer structural damage as a result of encountering severe clear air turbulence. In extreme cases this can lead to the break up of the aircraft. In even moderate turbulence, damage can occur to fittings within the aircraft especially as a result of collision with unrestrained items of cargo or passenger luggage.

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.\nHow does a Valley Inversion form?\nThe temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.\nConsequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.\nThus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

        "correct_answer": "Point 3",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThe figure shows a warm front followed by a cold front, a cross section of a very common polar front depression (travelling low). We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front.\nIn the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain.\nAt point 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain (sometimes heavy rain) ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form.\nAt point 3\n, long since the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much\ndependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass\n. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have\nstable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the Winter\n.\nThis would line up with the METAR in the question.\nPoint 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds.\nPoint 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties.\nThe lack of rain/heavy rain and NOSIG (no significant changes expected in the next two hours) in the METAR rule out point 4, where rain/heavy rain is pretty much guaranteed, and changes are very much expected within the next 2 hours as the cloud lowers and the warm front passes.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON\n:\nIn winter\n\u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON\n:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON\n:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator.\nAs the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon\n. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon).\nThe SW Monsoon affects all of India\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

For example, the 500 hPa level, in ISA conditions, corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations).\nIsohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed) ,then we can assume a low pressure.\nHaving that established,\u00a0it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts.\nThe closer the contours the stronger the wind.\nCirculation of air around a High and Low Pressure system:\nIn the Northern Hemisphere:\n-\u00a0The\u00a0air\u00a0moves anticlockwise\u00a0around a low pressure\u00a0centr\ne; and\n- Clockwise\u00a0around a high pressure\u00a0centre.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere:\n-\u00a0The\u00a0air\u00a0moves clockwise\u00a0around a low pressure\u00a0centre; and\n- Anticlockwise\u00a0around a high pressure\u00a0centre.\nWith regards to this question\n,\nWe can see that this question depicts a situation in the Northern Hemisphere, in Paris.\nNow,\u00a0notice the wind arrow on the lower right side of \"A\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from South - North, therefore indicating an anticlockwise direction =>\nwhich means that both are low pressure areas.\nThe tighter packed Isohypses show lower elevations\n,\nwider spaced isohypses show higher elevations\n=> by looking at the isohypses, we can see that the\u00a0contours at \"B\" are closer than at \"A\", therefore\ntrue altitude is higher over \"A\" than \"B\"\n.",

Temperature between +10\u00b0C and -10\u00b0C.\nLightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory. This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.\nWhile flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge\nThe main effects of a lightning strike are:\nTemporary blindness of the pilots\nMinor airframe damage\nMagnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked\nDisruption to electrical equipment",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nConvection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature.\nConvection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated\u2014i.e., to become less dense and to rise.\nWhen two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly.\nThe process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows:\nThe sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it.\nAs the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction.\nBecause surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others.\nThe faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and\nhigher\nup into the atmosphere the\nconvection\nextends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.)\nIn the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons.\nDuring noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point.\nAt this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time.\nThe temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCOLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL\nA cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nAs a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\n=> The weather activity within a cold pool is usually greatest in the afternoon, due to radiation and consequent warming of ground surfaces\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

(The biggest source for Western Europe)\nSiberia is a source of Polar Continental air. This is a huge source of air masses for much of the Northern Hemisphere.\n2: A tropical continental air mass can be a cold air mass.\nCORRECT\nAir mass theory is more about where the air mass comes from and how it is altered before and as it reaches a location. So if a warmer air mass moves over a place that is colder, it\u2019s comparatively a warm air mass. That doesn\u2019t mean that if that area of air moved in another direction it would be a warm air mass for them too, it is all relative.\nSo if a tropical air mass moved south over to a warmer area (an\nequatorial area\nwould likely be hotter)\n, then comparatively,\nthe tropical air mass would be colder air than the base conditions at that location.\nThere are 4 different adjectives we use for air masses, from coldest to warmest; Arctic, Polar, Tropical, Equatorial. Each can be continental (dry) or maritime (wet), and this depends on the source region and the track it has taken.",

        "explanation": "Haze\nis traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates obscure the clarity of the sky. Haze is primarily caused by particles in the atmosphere which\nscatter the sunlight.\nThe increase in airborne particulates combined with specific\n(low) sun angles\ncauses the slant range visibility to be reduced even further.\nAn aircraft landing \"into the sun\" will experience significant haze related visibility degradation => in this case, greatest visibility deterioration will occur when landing on runways close to a bearing of 270\u00ba - into the sunset. Runway 26 is very close to this, so would experience the same effect.\nWorst cases occur around sunrise and sunset during the summer months at times of day where haze-reduced visibility may be exacerbated by the low sun angle.\nNote\n: This is a very common type of question to encounter, usually referring to sunrise or sunset in haze, and 3000m seems to be an EASA favourite for the prevailing visibilty measurement. We do sometimes see feedback stating a different value for the minimum visibility occasionally, 1000m for instance, instead of 1500m. It should be clear in an exam which is correct.\nAny further exam feedback on this question would be appreciated, thanks.",

Please send us any further feedback you can remember from the real exam via the comments, your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can verify and improve the question, thank you!\nA Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) is the type that forms storms. For a CB to form, there must be three things;\ninstability, moisture, and a trigger\n(something which forces air to rise). When the cloud forms and the air is rising in an unstable air mass, the rising air does not cool down at the same rate as the surrounding environment, and this is what we call instability. This means that\nthe rising air wants to continue rising with more and more velocity.\nWhen instability and moisture are great enough, these clouds can form large CBs, which continue to accelerate as long as instability exists. If the air becomes more stable, then the cloud's development will slow down (as it no longer has as much of a temperature difference with the surrounding air.\nThis is\nmost commonly seen at the tropopause\n, where the surrounding air temperature stops changing (an isothermal layer), and all CBs are stopped at the tropopause, flowing outwards to form an \"anvil\" shape (sometimes overshooting with a small \"hat\" from the excess velocity).\nIsothermal layers are inherently very stable\n, as the rising air cools as it rises, so will never be the same temperature as air which remains the same temperature. This means that\ninversions are even more stable.\nStability is based on the environmental lapse rate (ELR - the rate at which the surrounding air cools with temperature) vs the Dry or Wet Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR or SALR) of the rising parcel of air. The DALR is constant and the SALR is close to constant, but the ELR varies massively. The greater the ELR (greater temperature drop per 1000 ft), the less stable the atmosphere.\nWhen the ELR is 0 (isothermal layer), or an inversion occurs, the air is absolutely stable.\nA strong inversion in the mid layers of the troposphere (so 10 - 20,000 ft) would\nstop a CB's development\nvery quickly indeed\n. All of a sudden, the rising air in the CB would not be warmer than the surrounding air, and would stop or sink instead of rising.\nThe cloud would have no further development above this point.",

However, in cold and dense air, pressure changes more rapidly and the pressure change will be more than that. Thus\nin colder than standard temperature QFF is more than QNH.\nSince the QFF (actual pressure at MSL) will be higher than the QNH, when the aircraft reaches MSL, the ambient pressure will be higher than the value set on the altimeter (QNH), therefore,\nit will indicate a value less than zero.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTroposphere\n= The lowest layer of our atmosphere.It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level.Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.\nStratosphere\n= The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.\nMesosphere\n= The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are found here.\nThermosphere\n= The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km.The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees.\nExosphere\n= The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth.However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space.\nIn the case of this specific question\n: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere).The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons.It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out.Practically taken as the height where the temperature fall is less than 2\u00b0C per 1000 ft.\nThe tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator\nThe tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes.\nThe tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter.\n1.When we move from the equator to the north pole, the temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the\naltitude of the tropopause decrease.\n2. Due to the overall decrease in temperature with altitude, the\ntemperature at the tropopause is lower/colder equatorward and higher/warmer poleward\n.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nIf the real temperature conditions were equal to ISA conditions, the thickness would be 3 000 ft\n(FL70 - FL40\n),\nhowever this is not the case.\nThe ISA deviation is ISA -10\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows: Correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-10) \u00d7 (3 000/1 000) =\n-120 ft\n.\nYou have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL70 and FL40 individually or to the layer thickness (FL70 - FL40). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.\nIn the case of a colder air mass, the deviation is a thinner layer, so we must subtract the temperature correction of 120 ft, giving us a layer thickness of\n2 880\nft.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDefinitions\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Consequently, the associated turbulence can catch individuals off guard. CAT can be severe, leading to structural damage, physical harm to both crew and passengers, and even impairing crew performance to the extent that simple tasks like reading instruments become nearly impossible.\nWhile NASA is actively developing various programs to enhance weather forecasting, the remote sensing of turbulence, especially CAT, using satellites remains a challenge, limiting the accuracy of forecasts.\nDuring flight,\nthe most reliable source of information on turbulence is the reports provided by pilots\n. It is crucial for pilots to report turbulence so that air traffic control (ATC) can issue advisories to other aircraft and provide requested information. Aircraft reports (AIREPs) are particularly valuable since they can indicate the presence of CAT if turbulence is reported by another aircraft flying along the same route. This information assists in determining the potential location of CAT.",

The primary sources of atmospheric humidity are the vast bodies of water on Earth, including oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers, which collectively cover more than 70% of the planet's surface. Within the lower troposphere, water vapor comprises approximately 0-5% of the air volume.\nHumidity levels vary across different regions. Desert areas typically exhibit low humidity, while tropical regions tend to experience high humidity due to their proximity to moisture-rich environments.\nThe approximate distribution of water vapour is almost 0 g/m\n3\nat the polar caps and as much as 25 g/m\n3\nat the equator\n.\nWater vapour plays a crucial role in meteorology as it contributes to the formation of clouds, fog, and precipitation through condensation. Essentially, it is responsible for the visible weather phenomena that occur in our atmosphere.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFOEHN EFFECT\nFoehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes\nof nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nIn terms of weather, we can expect:\n\u2022 Upwind side: clouds, precipitation and poor visibility,\n\u2022 Downwind side: clear skies, good visibility, turbulence.",

The air behind the warm front is warmer and moister than the air ahead of it (when the front passes, the air becomes warmer and more humid).\nThe slope of the warm air is approximately 1:100 to 1:150.\nWarm front is slower than a cold front. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to 2/3 of the geostrophic interval measured along the front.\nThe warm air is mostly stable, the clouds that form are mostly stratiform. As the warm front approaches, we typically see this sequence of clouds: Cl, CS, AS, NS.",

Vertical position at or above the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels (QNE). When passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when cllimbing and in terms of altitudes (QNH) when descending.\nAfter take-off, the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes (QNH set) until the Transition Altitude (TA). Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa)\nand altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels.\nPressure decreases with increasing height. Which means that when the pilot changes the altimeter setting from local QNH (1024 hPa), to a lower pressure (1013 hPa), the altimeter reading will decrease.\nAltimeter reading = TA - Pressure difference:\n1024 hPa - 1013 hPa = 11 hPa\n11 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =\n297\nft\nAltimeter reading = 11 000 ft - 297 ft =\n10 703 ft\nClosest option: 10 700 ft\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

Large\nsuper-cell thunderstorms\nare most likely to produce them.\nThe highest incidence is in the southern states of the USA (tornado alley) in the spring and early summer - very warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, moving north, meets relatively cold air coming from the northwest - which gives the massive instability and the windshear required.\nThey can last from several seconds up to (roughly) 30 minutes, in absolutely extreme cases they can even last over an hour - however, most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes\nIts speed of movement usually ranges from 20 - 40 kts and may have rotational speeds in excess of 200 kt.\nAveraging about 100 m in diameter\n(maximums are difficult to say, as the largest ever recorded was reported to be 4 km wide, but it is extremely rare to get them over even 1 km wide)\n.\nWithin Europe, tornadoes are much weaker systems whose maximum diameter is of the order of\n100 m - 150 m.",

However, we still believe that the correct option should be: (1) 10\u00baC; (2) 0\u00baC. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam. Thank you!\nIcing conditions are\nmostly\npresent within clouds below freezing temperature (0\u00baC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a \"supercooled\" state, in that their temperature is less than 0\u00baC, but they are still liquid. We call them Supercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs). When an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze, adhering to the airframe in the process.\nFor this question though, we have very little information, so have had to take some of the \"edge cases\" into account.\nIcing can also occur when the water droplets are close to freezing, but still just above\n,\nas long as the airframe is colder than freezing.\nThe slightly warmer water droplets will freeze upon hitting the colder airframe. In fact, this icing can be particularly dangerous, as it drips back over the wing very easily, forming clear ice. This can happen when the wings are \"cold-soaked\", and in some parts of the rain-ice triangle as well.\nThis is why we have said that icing can form with\noutside air temperatures of 10\u00baC or colder\n, as we know that it occasionally can, and this is the classification of icing conditions for most operators/aircraft, but that is partly due to SAT vs TAT and RAM rise. We think this is on the \"safe side\", which is where EASA examiners usually sit on this kind of topic.\nAlso to note, airframes at -40\u00baC would mean that the air is close to -40\u00baC also, and that is too cold to form airframe icing. You could argue this but it is inadvisable.",

        "explanation": "This question gives us very litte information, and we must choose the most correct answer out of the 4 options, which primarily requires us to understand the rough probabilities of a phenomenon occurring. Let's go through the options:\n\"Severe turbulence inside alto-lenticularis clouds.\"\nWhilst lenticular clouds do cause very strong wind shear and turbulence if a pilot goes too close to them or goes inside them, they are not a very common occurrence, as the winds and atmospheric conditions have to be within certain parameters for the mountain waves to form at all, and then a further set of conditions for lenticular clouds to form. Therefore,\nit would be unnecessary to brief them without knowing they are present\n, and they primarily occur in clear weather, so can be seen and avoided if necessary.\n\"Fog formation due to moist air descending into the valley.\"\nFog can form in the bottom of valleys, but this is due to the cold air from the mountainside flowing down into the valley, usually\nduring the night.\nIt is not something you can expect every time you fly into a valley, certain conditions have to exist. We do not have enough information to assume that this might be happening.\n\"Turbulence on the windward side of the hills due to up and down draughts.\"\nWhilst you can expect some turbulence on the windward side of a hill, it is primarily due to the air being forced upwards by the wind hitting the terrain, and therefore just updraughts. The airfield is also surrounded by mountains, so is\non the leeward side of each mountain, not the windward side.\n\"Rotor turbulence which could lead to loss of control.\"\nMost correct.\nThe rotor effects from winds going over mountains are incredibly common to observe, as they require a wind to be blowing, so happen almost all the time. They also form a lot of turbulence, particularly when the winds are strong, and are a good item to brief when descending into mountainous terrain.",

Certain surfaces, such as barren ground, rocky and sandy areas, are heated more rapidly than are grass covered fields and much more rapidly than is water. Insolation gives rise to convection currents - with warm air rising and cooler air descending, which are responsible for bumpy conditions as an airplane flies in and out of them.\n- Thermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 hrs on clear sunny days - In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.",

        "explanation": "TROPOPAUSE\nIt is the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere and it is where the temperature ceases to fall with an increase in height. The tropopause height varies with latitude and season - and it is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface.\n- The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause.\n- The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause.\nThe tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40\u00b0C over the poles and as low as -80\u00b0C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5\u00b0C.\nCalculating the average tropopause height (ft):\nTropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280\nfor winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result.\nLooking at the chart, we can see that the route from Recife to Dakar lies at around 3\u00ba.\nTropopause height = (16 x cos 3\u00ba) x 3280 = 52 400 ft\n=> In January, it is summer in Recife and winter in Dakar = we will choose the closest option to 52400 ft =>\n56 000 ft\nNote: the formula described in this explanation gives an approximate value.",

        "correct_answer": "1 only",
        "explanation": "See the comments - conflicting feedback.\nRefer to figure.\n(1) Polar lows are formed over water only\n.\nCORRECT\n.\nPolar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours.\nLike their tropical cousins, polar lows\ntend to decay rapidly with landfall\n, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This is the reason that they do not occur naturally over land (see note below).\n(2) Thermal lows are formed over land\nonly.\nINCORRECT\n.\nThermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong.\nOver land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area.\nThermal lows are most common over land masses but\nthey can form over water\nwhen the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season.\nNote: this question is very highly contested, and it seems that some authorities disagree on the correct answer. For instance\nthe Polish and Hungarian authority believe that \"1 only\" is the wrong answer and we believe that they choose \"both correct\" as the correct answer\n, even though we have good feedback from other authorities that \"1 only\" correct.\nWe say that the\nsecond most correct answer is \"none\"\n, as there can be debate as to the formation of polar lows; where they usually form over water, could they occur completely over land? We have to go off the exam feedback, and so would appreciate any further feedback on this question in the comments, or sent to info@atplquestions.com.\nSee Question 507748 for the other version of this question\n, which we believe the\nUK CAA\nare using (and maybe other authorities), and\nhas a more objective answer.",

        "explanation": "True Altitude depends on the mean temperature of the layer of air between the reference pressure surface and the static pressure surface (which is the level of the aircraft) and on the pressure. Thus, we need to use corrections on measured altitudes for temperature and pressure deviations from standard values.\nThe pressure altitude and the true altitude will be equal only when standard atmospheric conditions exist, i.e. there is no temperature deviation from ISA and the pressure at sea level is 1013 hPa.\nTo calculate the pressure adjustment, we apply the correction of 30 ft for each 1 hPa difference between QNH and 1013 hPa. Thus, if the actual QNH (pressure) in the area we are flying over is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than the indicated altitude. If the QNH (pressure) is higher than 1013 hPa, the true altitude is higher than the indicated altitude.\nIn simple words, we can say that flying from a high pressure towards a low pressure area, the true altitude decreases.",

Clear ice starts as dense\ntranslucent\nice with the formation of white horns.\nRime ice is a\nwhite opaque\ndeposit with a light texture.

        "explanation": "FREEZING FOG.\nIn its simplest sense, fog is a cloud near the ground that consists of tiny liquid water droplets. Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or when the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated.\nFreezing fog occurs when fog forms at temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain liquid. They become supercooled water droplets (SCWDs) remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This is the same process as having SCWD within a cloud.\nThis occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals are formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind, or on the leading edge of a wing that flies through it.\nFreezing fog can cause ice accumulation on the aircraft and the ground, so is also a dangerous weather phenomenon if not treated correctly.",

It does vary a little, depending on the state of the atmosphere in each location, but it is a good rule of thumb.\nIf we assume that the cold air has moved in at this altitude and above, our next step is to determine the ISA deviation. At FL180, the ISA temperature is -21\u00baC (15 - 2 x 18). Therefore, the temperature deviation from ISA is -9\u00baC. Similarly, at FL200, the ISA temperature is -25\u00baC, so the ISA deviation of -9\u00baC results in a temperature of\n-34\u00baC\n.

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nIn terms of weather, we can expect:\n\u2022 Upwind side: clouds, precipitation and poor visibility,\n\u2022 Downwind side: clear skies, good visibility, turbulence.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart\nand higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

        "explanation": "AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR\nAirborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation (such as rain/snow/hail).\nReflectivity\nWeather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity.\n=> Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water.\nIn some modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence\n. =>\nThis function (the TURB function) is based on the Doppler effect and is sensitive to precipitation movement.\nThe TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM\n(Doppler measurement capability) and\nshould only be used in wet turbulence\n.",

Mountain waves are very violent updrafts and downdrafts that occcur above, and downstream of, mountain ranges. In particular, the area insde and underneath a lenticular cloud contains extremely violent\nrotor turbulence effects\n, and should never be flown close to. When at only 1500ft above the maximum terrain elevation, the downdrafts from these mountain waves could easily overpower a piston aircraft's maximum rate of climb, causing potential\nterrain clearance issues\nalso.\nAnother problem with mountain waves is that they can, in the right conditions, c\nontinue upwards for tens of thousands of feet\n, up as high as the tropopause in some cases. This means that attempting to climb above them is a dangerous gamble, with potential for severe clear air turbulence, certainly not worth it, especially in this case. Sometimes the lenticular clouds will form in higher mountain wave layers, stacking up; sometimes they will not. If there are lenticular clouds around 9500ft, there will almost certainly be a lot of turbulence around 11,500ft also.\nThis track from Barcelona to Castres goes over the Eastern Pyrenees, and if you were to go\na few more miles East\n, you would be\nout of the mountain range area\n. This is\nnot an excessive diversion\nto make, and so could be completed safely. If this was not possible, then turning back would be the best course of action.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFRONTAL FOG\n.\nOccurs most often at a warm front or occlusion\n. It is most commonly caused by the evaporation of warm rain falling into colder, drier air beneath. It also exists from the gradual reduction of cloud base to the surface, which is also considered fog.\nThe fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only a few hours before the front passes and it clears.\nDissipation of frontal fog:\nby passing of the front\n(due to increasing temperatures and surface winds). As this question eludes to, the fog may not disappear immediately after the surface front passes, as the \"low cloud\" which we class as fog may be still yet to pass, so the fog will likely dissipate over a few minutes.\nNote: There is conflicting feedback on this question, and whilst we think the current correct answer is most correct, we disagree with the wording slightly, that the fog would clear only \"slowly\" after the front has passed.\nAny further exam feedback (including the exam authority if possible) would be very useful to verify the correct answer.",

As the surface loses heat energy through radiation, the clouds absorb this infrared radiation.

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze\n.\nBecause it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze\n(they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nThe\nFreezing\nProcess When a\nsupercooled water droplet\nstrikes an aircraft surface\n=>\nit begins to\nfreeze\n,\nreleasing latent heat\n.

The fuel, however, has a much larger thermal mass than the airframe, and will take much longer to warm up.\nThis means that the wings are what we refer to as \"\ncold-soaked\n\"\n, as they will be much colder than the surrounding air for a while.\nThis can be a problem, even on a warm day, depending on the moisture content of the air. If the air has a high enough moisture content, then\nany moisture that touches the wing will condense immediately\n, but due to the wing being below freezing temperature, will actually turn straight to ice on the wing\n(known as sublimation, or deposition, depending on the country). This forms icing on the wing,\nmost commonly in the form of\nfrost\n, similar to hoar frost but sometimes it can look a bit like mixed ice, depending on the conditions.\nTherefore, it is very likely that there will be\nfuel frost present on the wings\non the ground, and\nthe drizzle will also be likely to freeze to the cold soaked wing in flight\n, making the frost worse. This may require the pilots to take precautions such as re-fuelling with heated fuel, or delaying departure, if it is deemed necessary.",

        "explanation": "(1) Polar lows are formed over water only\n.\nCORRECT\n.\nPolar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours.\nLike their tropical cousins, polar lows\ntend to decay rapidly with landfall\n, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This may well be the reason that they do not occur naturally over land.\n(2) Thermal lows are\nmainly\nformed over land\n.\nCORRECT\n.\nThermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong.\nOver land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via re-radiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area.\nThermal lows are most common over land masses\nbut\nthey can form over water\nwhen the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season.\nNote\n: This is an offshoot question from Q501594 which has plenty of conflicting feedback. It appears that the UK CAA have decided to change option 2 to say \"mainly formed over land\", which is now correct.\nAny further exam feedback on this question can be placed in the comments here, and for the other question, search for 501594 and read the comments there, where there is more information.

A difference of wind speed of 20 kts between two relatively close sensors is a large indicator that\nwind shear is present\n, which is often caused by local weather systems such as thunderstorms, microbursts, etc.\nThe\ndowndrafts from a thunderstorm/microburst\nhit the ground with a large amount of speed, then\nspreading out sideways\n, causing strong squalls of wind that are extremely localised, meaning that they can arrive and disappear very quickly, causing\nsignificant change to an aircraft's air speed.\n\"A cold front passing the airfield is causing the wind to veer.\"\nIncorrect\n.\nAn active cold front can also generate hazardous windshear because of a rapid shift in wind direction. However, it typically accompanies a dynamic weather system, making wind speeds unlikely to drop as low as 5 knots in the vicinity of the front.\n\"A weak warm front passing the airfield is causing the change in the wind direction\"\nIncorrect.\nThe passage of a weak warm front typically results in only minor alterations in the wind.\n\"An active anticyclone over the airfield\"\nIncorrect\n.\nIn the center of an anticyclone, one can anticipate a broad region of gentle and variable winds.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON\n:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February\n, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over\ncentral India\n, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The\nSW Monsoon affects all of India\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa)\nand altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels.\nPressure decreases with increasing altitude, on this day, the pressure at mean sea level (QNH) is 980 hPa, and therefore the pressure level of 1013 hPa (standard pressure setting) is below this, somewhere under the surface.

We can say that there is a temperature inversion.\nAn inversion is a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere - where temperature increases with an increase in height.\nThe rain falling from the Nimbostratus cloud at 7\u00baC, will be quite warm. However, in this situation, because of the temperature inversion, the temperature decreases as altitude reduces. Falling through cold air (between 5 000 ft and 2 000 ft), the droplets become supercooled.\nFreezing rain consists of raindrops that have become supercooled after falling from warmer air into air where the temperature is below zero, which happens between 5 000 ft (+7\u00baC) and 2 000 ft (-4\u00baC)\n.

Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud, such as Cb - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

However,\nif the warm air is unstable, thunderstorms may be embedded among stratiform clouds ahead of a warm front,\u00a0and after frontal passage thundershowers may continue.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nStructural Icing\nIt builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.\nThere are 2 general types of structural icing:\nRIME ICE\nNormally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nFreezing Rain\noccurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0\u00b0C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0\u00b0C\nFreezing Rain can cause significant accumulations\nof clear ice\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore,\npressure correction is disregarded\n.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15\u00baC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-15) \u00d7 (34 000/1000) =\n2 040 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is\nsubtracted\nfrom the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad36 960 ft\n.\nTherefore, the height above ground = 36 960 ft - 29 092 ft =\n7 868 ft",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nWith 1013 hPa set on the altimeter, the altimeter indicates an altitude of 3 600 ft. If we change the altimeter setting to a lower pressure value, we will have a lower reference pressure.\nTo solve this question, all we need to do is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa =\n22 hPa\n. Since the question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = \u00ad\u00ad\n594 ft\n. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude\n= 3 600 ft - 594 =\n3 006 ft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDefinitions\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Both airborne weather radar and ground radar pick up returns from particles in the air (hail, rain, snow, etc.) and can detect turbulence from the doppler shift as those particles move about a lot.\nUnfortunately, this does nothing to help us detect clear air turbulence (CAT), as, by definition,\nthere are no particles to receive returns from\n, so RADARs will not pick it up. This is the same for\nsatellite sensors, which also would not be able to pick up this invisible phenomenon\n.\nThe absolute best way to\nreceive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft\n, as these give you\na location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time\n, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance.\nCAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is very much guesswork, and CAT can appear in unexpected places with no warning.

        "explanation": "Clear Ice or Glaze Ice\nIf a\nlarge supercooled water droplet\nstrikes an aircraft, it will start to freeze and this will\nrelease latent heat\n. This will delay the freezing process whilst part of the supercooled water droplet will\nflow back over the impact surface\nforming clear ice. The amount of a supercooled water droplet that freezes on impact is 1/80th of the droplet for each degree below freezing.\nClear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing.\nThe ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the build-up can be uneven. It is illustrated in\nFigure 16.1\n.\nPropeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage.\nClear ice forms in Ns, Cu and Cb at temperatures from 0 to -20 \u00b0C.\nIt is the most dangerous form of icing because 1) of the speed at which it can build up on the aircraft and 2) it might be very difficult to detect due to its transparency.",

These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for\nhundreds of miles\nin some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one.\nMountain waves (or standing waves) are therefore very dangerous to aircraft, and if the right conditions exist, mountain waves can continue as high as the tropopause in some cases.\nThere are some tell-tale signs of mountain waves though.\nLenticular clouds\n(cloud type lenticularis) are clouds which are shaped like a lens\n, and\nthey stay in the same location\n, even though the wind in their location is strong. They are\nindicative of the presence of mountain waves\n, and look very smooth, but actually contain lots of windshear and turbulence nearby and within them.\nWind rotors exist in the region of lenticular clouds, and sometimes have associated roll/rotor clouds, which are also indicative of severe turbulence.",

When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.\nTypes of lightning:\nIntra-Cloud lightning:\nThe most common type of lightning. It happens inside the cloud, jumping between different charge regions in the cloud. It lights up the cloud.\nCloud-to-air lightning:\nReferring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud.\nCloud-to-cloud lightning:\nHappens when a negatively charged cloud finds a positively charged cloud and opposites attract. The discharge travels from cloud to cloud.\nCloud-to-ground lightning:\nFlows from the cloud to the ground. Often\nhas downward \"branches\" or \"forks\" which come off at angles and discharge into the surrounding air.\nGround-to-cloud lightning:\nAlso known as upward lightning, and has the opposite direction of charge from the cloud-to-ground lightning above. The lightning flows upwards, and may have a few small upwards branches, but is mostly made up of just one path.",

        "explanation": "True Altitude is the real distance beneath the aircraft to the ground\n. The TA depends on the mean temperature of the layer of air between the reference pressure surface and the static pressure surface (level of the aircraft) and on the pressure.\nFor pressure correction, we apply a correction of 30 ft for each 1 hPa difference between the QNH and the standard 1013 hPa. If the actual QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than indicated altitude. If the QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, then true altitude is higher than indicated\nThe same logic can be used to answer this question. When flying into a low pressure area, the pressure (local QNH) will be decreasing. Thus,\ntrue altitude will decrease\n.\nIn such questions it might help if you remember that turning the knob of the altimeter anti-clockwise (left), the subscale indication decreases and also the altitude indication decreases (needle turning left).",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n).\nEngine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected\n. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown\nthat strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity)\ncan lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces.\nIt has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

However, as the air cools, its Relative Humidity (RH) will increase, and when it reaches the dew point, the RH will be 100% and the air is fully saturated. If the air continues cooling from this point, it will have to release water to do so, which forms a cloud.\nFor every degree difference between the dew point and the temperature, the\nRelative Humidity decreases by 5%.\nTherefore, we can calculate the Relative Humidity by saying that we have a 30 - 21 = 9\u2070C difference between OAT and dew point, which is 9 x 5 = 45% difference in RH, below the saturated 100%.\n100% - 45% =\n55% Relative Humidity",

As the number of water vapour molecules increases, the vapour pressure increases. The saturation vapour pressure depends on the temperature of the surface and on the type of surface.\nFor a liquid surface it will be much easier for water molecules to break free and evaporate than for a solid surface (ie. Ice). That is because the bonds between adjacent molecules are stronger in an ice surface than they are in a water surface. At the same temperature, fewer molecules will break free from an ice surface than from a water surface,\n=> Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure over liquid water.",

This happens when two masses of air are pushing against each other but neither is powerful enough to move the other.\nThe situation can be described winds blowing parallel to the front instead of perpendicular can help it stay in place.\nThe exact weather of a stationary front depends greatly on the characteristics of its constituent air masses - their moisture levels, for example - and the general instability of the local atmosphere. Often, however, conditions resemble those encountered along warm front weather:\nextensive cloudiness and continuous rain\n.\nA wide area of precipitation can be expected on the cold-air side.\nSince there is little frontal movement, weather conditions are likely to be comparatively quiet, though longer lasting.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThe\nSun provides the energy that heats the Earth\nand its atmosphere by a process of\ninsolation\n(incoming solar radiation). This is short wave radiation in the form of light, ultraviolet, and many other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nAfter insolation has occurred,\nthe surface of the Earth warms up, and produces longer wave radiation (\ninfrared\nradiation)\n, as well as conduction and convection, which heats the atmosphere from the ground.\nThe greenhouse effect is how the Earth manages to keep its heat in. The greenhouse gasses mostly allow the short wave radiation to penetrate down to the ground, but then keeps a lot of the longer wave radiation in, similar to a greenhouse, which lets shortwave radiation (sunlight) in through the glass walls, but keeps the long wave infrared radiation in to warm up the internal atmosphere for the plants.\nIf the Earth did not have any greenhouse effect, the atmosphere would get very cold, particularly during the night.\nThe greenhouse effect comes from the presence of many different gasses in the atmosphere, and include water vapour, and to a certain extent, clouds as well. The majority of the atmosphere exists beneath the tropopause,\nwithin the troposphere\n, and therefore\nthe vast majority of atmospheric heating happens below the tropopause.\nThe radiation which is trapped is the\ninfrared\n(long wave radiation)\n, and the ultraviolet from the Sun is allowed to pass through the greenhouse gasses (CO\n2\n, NO\n2\n, etc.).",

It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level.Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.\nWith increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.\nStratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.\nThe lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.\nMesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground.With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases.The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are found here.\nThermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km.The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees.\nExosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth.However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space.\nConduction = The transfer of heat energy by direct contact.\nConvection = The transfer of heat by the motion of a matter, the mixing of liquids or gasses.\nRadiation = The transfer of heat by electromagnetic radiation (waves).\nIn the case of this specific question\n: The altitude where the stratosphere begins can differ.\nThe height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons.\nIt is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out.\nThe lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator\nThe lower boundary of the stratosphere is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes.\nThe lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter.\nThe base of the stratosphere is therefore lower near the poles because of the low ground temperatures.",

To put this into prespective, when we reach the tropopause, the\ntemperature lapse rate changes from 2\u00baC/1 000 ft to less than two-thirds of 1\u00baC/1 000 ft\n. This is what they mean by \"abrupt change\".\nAs you can see in the attached figure, in the troposphere, the temperature first decreases with altitude. In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere.\nThat is why the temperature laps rate changes abruptly at the tropopause.",

        "correct_answer": "Low level wind shear.",
        "explanation": "If an indication of a temperature inversion is given as part of an ATIS, it means that it is quite a noticeable inversion.\nInversions occur when the air gets warmer with increased altitude\n, so when warmer air is above colder air. This can happen for many reasons, due to night cooling, valley inversions, frontal activity, etc.\nAn inversion is incredibly stable, meaning that there is very little vertical movement of air through the inversion. This means that\nlittle to no mixing occurs\n, and therefore, the wind velocity (speed and direction) below the inversion may be totally different from the wind velocity above the inversion, and the difference may happen over a very small band of altitude.\nThis means that flying through an inversion has the potential for quite significant vertical wind shear (changing wind velocity with changing altitude).\nThis is why information about them are passed to pilots, so they can expect the wind shear and make decisions based on it.\nInversions can also have large effects on aircraft performance, and the aircraft performance will be better below the inversion in the colder air.\nTo look at the options:\n\"The altimeter will overread the aerodrome elevation when the QNH is set.\"\nThis is not correct, as\nthe QNH pressure is set at aerodrome elevation, so will read the correct altitude when on the ground\n. The air is very cold so some temperature errors will exist when flying around, but as mentioned above, not when using QNH whilst on the ground.\n\"Reduced braking performance.\"\nThe ATIS said nothing about a wet or contaminated runway, braking performance might be perfectly fine.\n\"Low visibility due to snow.\"\nThe ATIS made no mention of snow.\n\"\nLow level wind shear.\n\"\nCorrect. As mentioned above, the inversion may cause wind shear at low levels when passing through it.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nHail\nis commonly associated with\ncumulonimbus (CB) clouds\n, which exhibit noticeable strong updrafts and downdrafts. Within these CB clouds, precipitation particles have the opportunity to grow larger due to the aggregation of ice crystals and\nsupercooled water droplets\n, ultimately resulting in the formation of hail. When the size of these ice particles exceeds 5 mm, they are referred to as hailstones.\nAs the hailstones continue to grow, they eventually reach a critical size that cannot be sustained by the upward air currents within the cloud. Consequently, they begin to fall from the cloud toward the ground. However, there is a possibility for hailstones to rise again if they are carried into an area with a strong updraft. This process can lead to the repeated aggregation of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstones, contributing to their further growth. This repeated cycle of aggregation and growth results in the layered structure of hailstones, resembling the layers of a cabbage or an onion.\nAdditionally, the hailstone can also grow through sublimation, where water vapor in the cloud condenses directly onto the hailstone, further increasing its size.",

Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the warmer air mass) are typically out of the southwest.

        "correct_answer": "23 770 ft AMSL.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked to determine the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1023 hPa - 1013 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n270 ft\n. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude\n= 25 000 ft + 270 ft =\n25 270\nft.\nTo determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (25 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-35 \u00baC. The actual outside air temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-50 \u00baC, which means we have an ISA deviation of\nISA -15\u00baC.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15\u00baC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-15) \u00d7 (25 270/1000) =\n-1 516 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 25 270 ft - 1 516 ft =\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad23 754 ft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCOLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL\nA cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nAs a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart\nand higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nWEATHER ATTENUATION\nThe weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs.\nThe stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,\nRadar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.\nTip for avoiding shadows:\nTo accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.\nIf you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.\nIf you don\u2019t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it\u2019s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at 16 200 ft\n(14 200 + 2 000).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nTo compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6 500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (6 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad+2\u00baC. The actual temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-23\u00baC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -25\u00baC.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -25\u00baC\n. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 200 ft - 6 500 ft =\n9 700 ft\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-25) \u00d7 (9 700/1000) =\n-970\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded to\nthe true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad17 170 ft\n.\nThe minimum indicated altitude in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2000 ft is\n17200 ft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,\nthe thinner the air and the less performance from your engines\n(and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion,\ntemperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreased aircraft performance\n, leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air.\nSUMMARY: An inversion marks the boundary between layers of air having differing temperatures and to some extent density. This will result in an aircraft gaining lift, thrust and power when descending through an inversion with the reverse conditions when climbing.",

This sector shows isolated scattered/broken cumulus and stratocumulus - with\nmoderate icing\nto the East of the sector, we are in the West of the sector so\nthat does not affect us.\nWe can expect moderate turbulence at 3 000 ft for this section of flight,\nbut no icing\n.\nIn the second half of flight, we pass through sector \"B\" which has an occluded front followed by a slow moving cold/warm front reversal, so many different weather conditions can be expected in this area. In terms of icing, sector \"B\" contains cumulus and stratocumulus clouds which are overcast in the frontal areas between cloud bases of 1 500-3 000ft and tops of 5 000 - 8 000ft. The 0\u00baC level in sector \"B\" is between 4 000 ft and 6 000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0\u2070C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case. Also, NASA quotes ice as being worst between +2\u2070C and -20\u2070C, so we know it can happen in low positive temperatures.\nThe aircraft cannot therefore avoid icing conditions on that route at any of the given levels.\nNote: There is some debate over whether the aircraft could remain outside of icing conditions at 3 500 ft, as that is lower than the 0\u00baC isotherm in the B region, however, the CU/SC cloud that would be encountered does include moderate icing and turbulence, and icing can occur just above 0\u00baC, so we are agreeing with the most recent feedback that 3500 ft would not be able to avoid moderate icing.",

        "explanation": "Cumulus clouds form primarily through the process of\nconvection\n. It begins when the Earth's surface is heated by the sun, warming the air just above it. Warm air is lighter and less dense than cool air, so it begins to rise. As the warm air rises, it cools adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), and when it reaches its dew point temperature (the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture), water vapor starts to condense into tiny water droplets. These droplets cluster together to form visible cumulus clouds. These clouds can grow rapidly, when the atmosphere is unstable, with no upper-air inversion, and may develop into cumulonimbus clouds, with their tops reaching the tropopause.\nThe vertical extent of cumulus clouds is limited by the stability of the atmosphere\n. If the atmosphere is stable, meaning that the temperature decreases with height (\ninversion\n). A subsidence inversion occurs when there is a layer of sinking or subsiding air in the atmosphere. This sinking air warms adiabatically (without heat exchange) as it descends, causing a temperature increase with height.\nThis warm layer acts as a lid or cap on the rising warm air, preventing it from ascending further.",

This reflection prevents a considerable amount of solar energy from reaching the Earth's surface, resulting in cooler maximum surface temperatures compared to when the sky is clear.\nAt night\n, the situation changes.\nClouds\nhave the ability to\nabsorb\nand trap thermal radiation, particularly infrared radiation, which is emitted by the Earth's surface. As the surface loses heat energy through radiation, the clouds absorb this infrared radiation. The absorbed energy is then re-radiated back towards the surface, effectively acting as a blanket or insulator. This re-radiation of the absorbed infrared radiation by clouds helps to maintain warmer surface temperatures during the night compared to clear sky conditions.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at 14 500 ft\n(12 500 + 2 000).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -25\u00baC\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-25) \u00d7 (14 500/1000) =\n-1 450\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded to\nthe true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad15 950 ft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 980 hPa = 33 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 33 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 990 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 15 950 ft + 990 ft =\n16 940 ft\n.\nThe lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is\nFL\n17\n0\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLearning Objective 050.08.03.04.03: Identify cold-air drops on weather charts.\nA cold-air drop is a mass of cold polar air which becomes separated from the other polar air by transiting towards the warmer air in the subtropical region. This can take a few different forms, but the most usual form is that the air between 10-30,000ft is much colder in one patch (sometimes called a cold-air pool), than the sub-tropical air around it. This cold air means that\nthe column of air in that region is much shorter than around it\n, as\npressure drops off more quickly with increasing height in a cold air mass\n. The cold air becomes trapped, and usually forms a circle.\nThis does\nform a low pressure zone higher up in the troposphere\n, which can be seen on medium and high level pressure charts. It also forms a region where there is a huge amount of cold air sat on top of warm (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere. This means that there is a very high environmental lapse rate, the warm air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink, and this causes layers of massive instability.\nIt can often only be seen by\ncomparing pressure charts for different levels\nto see the change in pressure due to the thermal effect, but\nnot by looking\nonly\nat the surface pressure, where it may not be visible\n. The later stages of a cold-air drop usually ends up as a low pressure zone at the ground also, but this is\nnot examined by EASA.\nThe higher pressure chart should show an area of lower pressure that does not exist on the surface (or lower altitude) chart.\nThis means that the thermal effect has taken place, and that\nthe area has cold air in it.\nIn this case,\nthere are two possible diagrams which show a resemblance to this\n.\nFigure 1 and Figure 4\nboth show more low pressure on the 700 hPa charts that the surface charts.\nThe difference between them is the size of the cold-air drop.\nFigure 1\nshows\nlower pressure over the whole region of the image\n(which is in comparison to the area outside the image), meaning that the potential\ncold-air drop\nwhich has caused it would be\nvery large\n.\nFigure 4\n, however, shows a\nsmaller, isolated cold-air drop\n(low pressure zone) in the middle of the 700 hPa chart, which did not appear on the surface chart which showed a neutral \"col\" pressure distribution.\n700 hPa is approximately equivalent to 10,000ft\n, so the thermal effect has not had too much time to take effect, but at higher levels, the cold-air drop would be even more visible on the charts.\nNote: We have had conflicting feedback about this question. We have had enough feedback and\na reply to an appeal from the Hungarian CAA\nthat Figure 1 is correct\n, however we think figure 4 is also a possible cold air drop, and our initial feedback also supported that. See the comments for the most recent feedback, and keep putting exam feedback in the comments when possible, thank you!",

        "correct_answer": "4 500 ft",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude = 10 000 ft - 690 ft =\n9 310 ft\n.\nTo determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-5\u00baC. The actual outside air temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad0 \u00baC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +\n5\u00baC\n.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +5\u00baC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 9 310 ft - 1 500 ft = 7 810 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (5) \u00d7 (7 810/1000) =\n156 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n9 466 ft\n.\nTherefore, the height above ground = 9 466 ft - 5 000 ft =\n4 466 ft\n(4 500 ft is the closest option).\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.\nThe denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.\nThe slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.\nCold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.\nPrecipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 \u2013 185 km) \u2013 mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.\nA winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.\nClouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns.\n- Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation.\n- An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.\nNOTE\n:\nCumulus clouds are the most common\ncloud types that are produced by cold fronts. They often grow into cumulonimbus clouds, which produce thunderstorms.\nCold fronts can also produce nimbostratus, stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLearning Objective 050.01.01.02.04: Describe the variations of the FL and temperature of the tropopause from the poles to the equator.\nThe atmosphere is split up into many different layers. The lowest layer is the troposphere, followed by the stratosphere. In general, these are the two that pilots care about most. The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause, and is where the stratosphere begins.\nThe atmosphere is not always the same height though, in fact it varies wildly in height between the tropics and the poles.\nOver the equator, the atmosphere is very tall\n, due to both heat (meaning that pressure reduces at a lower rate with altitude) and other effects such as convection and general circulation of air.\nThe atmosphere over the poles has much less height\n, this is mostly to do with the reduced convection and the cold air, which loses pressure more quickly with altitude.\nThe height of the troposphere (which is indicative of the atmosphere in general) will therefore change from season to season, as solar heating differs due to the angle of the sun to the ground.\nIn the winter season, in general a hemisphere will have a lower tropopause, and in the summer, a higher tropopause\n. This also coincides with how close a particular place is to the ITCZ, the heat equator, which moves with the seasons.\nIn the tropics, the tropopause reaches around FL550 in summer, dropping a little in the winter, depending on where in the tropics.\nAt the poles, it can drop to as low as FL200 around the winter time, and up to around FL250 in the summer.\nThe\nISA (International Standard Atmosphere) has the tropopause at 36 090 ft\n, which is a good average for areas at\n40-50\u00ba Latitude\n(above this in summer, below it in winter). Therefore\nFL250 to FL350\nsounds plausible for 55\u00ba N\n, which equates to the South of Scotland, or around the latitude of Denmark.\nNote: You only need a rough idea of tropopause heights for this question (especially as two answers can be removed for having higher winter heights than summer heights, which is not correct) and the learning objective above is vague, but does not require memorizing a table or any such deep knowledge.",

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -20\u00baC\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-20) \u00d7 (7 400/1000) =\n-592 ft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded\nto the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of \u00ad\u00ad\n7 992\nft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa =\n23 hPa\n. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:\nPressure correction\n= 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =\n690 ft\n. This value needs to be\nadded\nto the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 7 992 ft + 690 ft =\n8 682 ft\n.\nAccording to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:\nFor Easterly magnetic tracks (000\u00b0 - 179\u00b0), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)\nFor Westerly magnetic tracks (180\u00b0 - 359\u00b0), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)\nThe aircraft flies an\neasterly magnetic track\n. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is:\nFL90\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLearning Objective 050.09.07.01.01: Summarise the advantages of stratospheric flights.\nLearning Objective 050.09.07.01.02: List the influences of the phenomena associated with the lower stratosphere (\nwind, temperature, air density\n,\nturbulence\n).\nNote: this is the first question in this section (stratospheric conditions) that has been ever been known to be examined by EASA. We expect that more similar questions may be added by EASA in future.\nWith the question being so new, any exam feedback about it (or any similar questions) would be greatly appreciated, and can be sent to\ninfo@atplquestions.com\nor put in the comments, thank you.\nIn the stratosphere, which is the layer of atmosphere above the troposphere, starting at 36,000 ft in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the\ntemperature stays the same\n(\nisothermal layer\n) up to around 60,000ft, where it then begins to gradually increase again. The lower levels of the stratosphere would therefore be around the region of 36,000 to 50,000ft\nThis means that the lower levels of the stratosphere have decreasing pressure with height (the same occurs all through the atmosphere) but\nthe temperature remains the same (warmer than it would otherwise be)\n. In the troposphere, the reduction in temperature with altitude allows some density to be regained (as cold air is denser), but this does not happen in the stratosphere, meaning that\nthe air density drops off quicker than it would in the corresponding troposphere.\nThis also means that the stratosphere is also completely stable due to the isothermal nature of it.\nLet's go through each option individually:\nStratospheric flight levels have lower density (therefore higher density altitude) than if it were the troposphere, which means that the\njet engines can run at their peak efficiency\n, as they are effectively at a higher altitude. This compounds with the fact that the stratospheric flight levels are high up anyway, giving them\nvery efficient flight characteristics\neven without the effect of the isothermal layer.\nThe reduced density also gives a\nhigher TAS\nwhen flying at a\nconstant IAS\n, and the warmer temperature means that\nTAS will be higher when flying at a constant Mach number\n(which is much more likely).\nEmissions within the stratosphere have been studied to have a\ndifferent impact\non the environment, but\nnot necessarily less of an impact\n.\nMountain waves can extend well into the stratosphere in some cases, and EASA formally recognise that as part of the mountain waves syllabus.\nThere will be less clouds in the low stratosphere\n, as cloud form due to uplift (mostly) which does not occur, and\nthe isothermal layer is completely stable.\nThere are some rare clouds that do occur (noctilucent, polar stratospheric, etc.), as well as the peaks of some violent CBs that penetrate the tropopause with their high upwards momentum.\nLess wear on the engines is not true\n, as the engines will have to spin at a\nhigher RPM\nto maintain thrust output in the low density air (which is actually more efficient), but will cause\nmore wear\ndue to the high rotational speeds.\nLess turbulence is probably the easiest one to work out of this whole selection, as this is what the stratosphere is best at,\nproducing low turbulence, stable conditions.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLIGHTNING is a huge electrical discharge that flows between clouds, from a cloud to air, or from a cloud to the ground. It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10\u00b0C and -10\u00b0C.\nLightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory. This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.\nWhile flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge\nThe main effects of a lightning strike are:\nTemporary blindness of the pilots\nMinor airframe damage\nMagnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked\nDisruption to electrical equipment\nNote:\nAircraft cointaining composite materials (which have not been made conductive) will be severely damaged by lightning strike.",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.\nIt is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1025 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic.\nLet\u2019s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure:\n1025 \u2013 1013 = 12 hPa\nAssuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa:\n12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft\nThe aircraft is 6 000 ft \u2013 5 640 ft =\n360 ft\nlower than remaining traffic.\nNote 1: The local QNH (1025 hPa) is higher than the standard pressure (1013 hPa). This means that the local QNH datum is lower than the 1013 datum => the aircraft is lower than the remaining traffic.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.\nTo compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (8 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (8 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad-1\u00baC. The actual temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad+12\u00baC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA +13\u00baC.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +13\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (+13) \u00d7 (8 000/1000) =\n416 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n8 416\nf\nt\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere.\nNote: In the tropopause, pressure continues to drop as altitude increases.",

The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force (PGF). The PGF is now more dominant,\nand the wind blows across the isobars TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE LOWER PRESSURE.\nThis wind is called surface wind.\nIn the\nNorthern Hemisphere\n, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the\nleft\ncompared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (first annex above).\nIn this diagram, the free stream wind (gradient wind - as it is orbiting the high) will simply follow the isobars clockwise around the high, not getting any closer. The surface wind, on the other hand, is directed slightly outwards (second annex above), so spirals outwards. This means that\naircraft \"B\" is pointing directly into wind\n, and it is also in an area of\ntighter isobars\n, meaning that\nthe windspeed will be higher aswell\n.",

That is what the question is asking,\nwhat is the pressure altitude upon landing\n?\n520 ft is technically called our \"indicated altitude\" as that is what would show on our altimeter if QNH was set, and the difference between indicated and pressure altitude is the barometric (pressure) correction. The QNH is 1003, which is\n10 hPa less than standard\n(1013 hPa)\nPressure correction = 10 x 27 = 270 ft\nAs the pressure is\nlower than standard\n, the\nindicated altitude is going to be lower than the pressure altitude (pressure high, indicated altitude high; pressure low, indicated altitude low)\n.

In some regions, such as Europe, there are also a number of stations which provide VOLMET broadcasts on very high frequency (VHF) radio.\nIn both cases, the station will use automated voice transmission to broadcast TAF, SIGMET and METAR information for a published list of aerodromes.\nVHF stations normally broadcast their information in a continuous loop updating the information as changes occur.\nHF VOLMET stations generally broadcast on a published schedule with five minute intervals allocated to each station,\nthus preventing overlapping transmission on the same frequency.\nA listing of VOLMET broadcasts by provider, inclusive of broadcast time, frequency(s) and a list of aerodromes for which information is provided, can be found in the appropriate en-route supplements for the region in question.\nWith the ever increasing availability of SATCOM and Data Link equipment such as ACARS, the reliance on VOLMET is diminishing.

        "explanation": "DEW POINT TEMPERATURE\nWarmer air can hold more water vapour than cold air, It can be imagined that a warm parcel of air is a bigger bucket than a cold parcel of air.\nThe dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to\n(at constant pressure)\nin order to achieve saturation (= a relative humidity (RH) of 100%). In simple words, it is the temperature at which the air can no longer \"hold\" all of the water vapour which is mixed with it (the bucket has shrunk) - and some of the water vapour must condense into liquid water. The dew point is always lower than (or equal to) the air temperature.\nIncreasing air temperature has no effect on dew point. Decreasing air temperature also does not have any effect on dew point,\nuntil dew point temperature is reached (or below).\nAt this point, the air is fully saturated, and the water that is \"forced out\" will condense into water droplets, as in a cloud. As the dew point can never be more than the temperature, then\nthe dew point also reduces with the air temperature.",

The student who provided the feedback did not disclose any of the provided answer options. Our intention in creating this question was to assist you in preparing for a similar type of question; however, it is highly unlikely that you will encounter these options in your actual exam. If you happen to come across a similar question in your official examination, we kindly request that you inform us. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\nWhen a polar front approaches a mountain range in southern Europe, the expected weather conditions can vary. However, there are some general patterns that can be observed.\nTypically, as the polar front encounters the mountain range, it is forced to rise due to the barrier presented by the mountains.\nAs the air rises, it cools and condenses, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation\n. The precipitation can be in the form of rain, snow, or a mix of both, depending on the altitude and temperature.\nThe interaction between the polar front and the mountain range can result in significant weather changes. Some of the common weather conditions associated with this scenario include:\nIncreased precipitation\n: The forced ascent of the air along the mountain range can lead to enhanced precipitation, potentially causing heavy rainfall or snowfall.\nStrong winds\n: The interaction between the polar front and the mountains can generate strong and gusty winds, particularly in the vicinity of the mountain passes and slopes.\nThunderstorms\n: The lifting of warm and moist air along the mountain range can contribute to the development of thunderstorms, especially if there is a strong contrast in air masses.\nRapid weather changes\n: The passage of the polar front can bring about rapid shifts in weather conditions, with alternating periods of rain, sunshine, and possibly even dramatic temperature fluctuations.",

        "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.09.01.04.03: Identify weather situations and their relevant areas where high concentrations of ice crystals are likely to occur.\nIce crystal icing (ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that\nstrong convective weather\n(thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud\n- the area where the\nvisible anvil shape\nis seen when viewed from a distance.\nThese areas are perfect places for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of\nhuge convective clouds\nwith plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes. Therefore, we can keep a good lookout for such clouds using our onboard weather radar,\nwhich readily picks up cumulonimbus clouds\ndue to their large water content.\nThis question calls them\noceanic mesoscale convective systems\n, which simply means that the storms are\nfull of moisture\nfrom the sea below, and are at least\nmedium in size\n. Smaller convective systems would not be powerful enough to cause significant ice crystal icing.",

        "correct_answer": "280\u00b0/18 kt",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nSURFACE WIND\nThe geostrophic wind at altitude flows perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, due to the coriolis force. The coriolis force only becomes effective when enough speed has been gained, and near the ground, this speed is continuously reduced by friction. This means that the wind speed at the surface less than the\nfree stream flow (geostrophic or gradient wind)\n. We sometimes call this\nfree stream flow the \"2000 ft wind\"\nbecause the boundary layer of the surface friction has usually ended by that height, so the \"2000 ft wind\" is usually unaffected by the surface friction.\nSurface wind is not just reduced in speed though, it is also\nchanged in direction due to the reduction in coriolis force\n. This means that the surface wind will be more affected by the pressure gradient force (PGF) than the coriolis force (CF), so will flow towards the low pressure somewhat.\nThis means that\nin the Northern Hemisphere, the surface wind is \"backed\" from the free stream wind\n, to go towards the low pressure (and it is \"veered\" in the Southern Hemisphere).\nThe degree to the speed reduction and the subsequent direction change depends on\nthe\nsurface type (its friction)\nand the\ntime of day (amount of vertical mixing)\n.\nDay\nNight\nDirectional change\nPercentage of \"2000 ft wind\"\nDirectional change\nPercentage of \"2000 ft wind\"\nLand\n30\n\u00b0\n50%\n40\u00b0\n30%\nSea\n10\u00b0\n70%\n10\u00b0\n70%\nSo in Brussels during the day, the surface wind (\n9 kt\n) can be expected to be\n50% of the \"2000 ft wind\n\". Therefore, the \"\n2000 ft wind\" (free stream wind) would be approximately\n18 kt.\nFurthermore, the direction is expected to be 30\u00ba different. As mentioned above, the surface wind is backed by this amount in the Northern Hemisphere, which means that the \"2000 ft\" wind is veered by 30\u00ba from the surface wind. Veering is an increase in the direction number, and backing is a decrease. Therefore,\nthe \"2000 ft wind\" (free stream wind) would be coming from approximately 250 + 30 =\n280\n\u00b0\nThe correct answer is\n280\n\u00b0\n/18 kt",

        "explanation": "\u201cThe actual temperature of an air mass is higher than the dew point temperature if the air mass is unsaturated.\" CORRECT\nDew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for saturation to occur. When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated (relative humidity = 100%). Dew point temperature can\nnever be greater\nthan the air temperature. Therefore, if the air cools below the original dew point, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation.\nSummary:\n\u2022 for\nunsaturated air \u2013 dew point is lower than air temperature\n; and\n\u2022 for saturated air \u2013 dew point is equal to air temperature.\n\"For a saturated air mass, the dew point temperature over ice is lower than the dew point temperature over water.\" INCORRECT\nThis one is a bit more complicated, but in simple terms, if the air temperature is below the freezing point of water (0\u00baC) and therefore ice crystals can be formed instead of water droplets, then the air will\nfavour the formation of ice.\nDue to the saturation vapour pressure over ice being lower than water, the amount of water vapour that can be held before forming ice crystals is LESS than can be held before forming water droplets.\nThis means that\nice crystals are formed\nearlier\nthan water droplets\n, so\nice has a\nHIGHER temperature frost point\nthan water's\ndew point.\n(They have referred to \"dew point temperature over ice\" which is the same as \"frost point\").",

We are not required to know the air masses for Australia in the syllabus, but we do need to understand broadly how air masses cause different types of weather.\nWhen a\ncold air mass advects over a warmer surface\n(\nPolar air moving towards the tropics\n, for example), the lower layers of air are heated by the ground, which creates instability.\nI\nt can be though of that the low level warm air wants to rise through the cold air, which is an unstable air mass. That is not exactly how it works, but is a good way to remember it.\nIf air were to move from a warm source region to a colder area of surface, the warm air would be cooled from below, creating a stable air mass.\nIt can be thought of like this; the cold air is more than happy to sit below a warmer air mass, so remains stable.\nInstability\ncauses cumuliform clouds,\nwhich cause rain to fall as showers and storms\n, whereas stability tends to create stratiform clouds and fog, with rain falling lighter but more continuously.\nCold Polar air moving over Australia is a\ncold air mass moving over a warmer surface\n, so will cause\ninstability and showers.",

        "explanation": "HUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.\nHumidity Measurement\nAbsolute Humidity\nRefers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3\nSaturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)\nMaximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.\nHumidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)\nThe ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.\nExpressed as g/kg of dry air.\nRelative Humidity (RH)\nThe ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.\nDepends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.\nRH = (HMR/SMR) x 100\nRH 100% = Saturation\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.\nFrom the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.\nRelative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn\u2019t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.",

It also meant that the final answer we got does not correspond directly with any of the options, although we can make a fair guess at \"\n1358 ft\n\" being correct (as further detail about the elevation of the QNH measuring station that may have been missed from the question could easily make 1358 ft correct).\nWe have had to assume that the\nOAT is measured at the aircraft and that the QNH was measured at sea level\n. These are not always the case, and were ambiguous in our feedback.\nThe aircraft's indicated altitude is 4500ft. We know that the\ntrue altitude\nof the highest obstacle is 3120 ft. We must therefore calculate the aircraft's true altitude from the indicated altitude, which is a simple matter of a temperature correction.\nIn an ISA atmosphere, the temperature at the aircraft's altitude (4500 ft) would be 15 - 2(4.5) = 6\u00baC. The actual outside air temperature is 4\u00baC, so the OAT is ISA -2\u00baC.\nTEMPERATURE CORRECTION\nA good way to remember this part is to think that\ntrue altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high\n. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA.\n==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude.\n==>\nWhen OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.\nAs this scenario has an OAT of 2\u00baC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this.\nTemperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA)\nSo for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 4.5 x 2 = 36 ft.\n4500 - 36 = 4464 ft, the aircraft's true altitude.\n4464 - 3120 =\n1344 ft\nobstacle clearance (closest answer\n1358 ft\n).",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at 15 000 ft\n.\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-15) \u00d7 (15 000/1 000) = -900 ft.\nThe temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad15 900 ft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =\n300 ft\n. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 15 900 ft + 300 ft =\n16 200 ft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDefinitions\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze\n.\nBecause it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze\n(they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(\nLarge supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

        "explanation": "Mountainous areas significantly influence the weather. Generally, the higher and steeper the mountain, the greater its effect on weather. Orography enhances the updraft of air and thus enhances the development of water droplets that are large in size.\nAs the air is forced to ascend on the upwind side of the mountain, it cools down adiabatically to its dew point. This leads to the formation of clouds, and even precipitation. Weather fronts are also modified if they reach mountainous regions. An additional mechanical lifting effect\nstrengthens the updraft\n- as a result, embedded Cu and Cb clouds may form.\nThis enhances icing, turbulence and the formation of precipitation primarily on the upwind side\n.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nOn a night of clear skies with calm or light surface wind, a temperature inversion can form due to surface cooling -\nwhich can lead to windshear\n.\nTemperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude.\nStrong inversions are known to happen in desert areas, such as Saudi Arabia, where the surface will heat up quickly during the day and cool off rapidly at night.\nDue to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong =>\nwind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above\n.\nThis wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion.\n- Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind =>\nwhich causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in Rate of Climb\n. The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground.\n- Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,\nthe thinner the air and the less performance from your engines\n(and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreases aircrafts performance leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air -\nwhich reduces the aircraft's rate of climb.",

In this stage, a boundary separates opposing fronts of cold and warm air. When an upper level disturbance moves over the front, it causes a wave to form.\nCyclonic shear begins to happen when the warm and cold fronts slide against each other => which generates the spinning motion characteristic of cyclones\n.\n2. DEVELOPED/MATURE STAGE\n\u2013 during this stage, the wave formed during the initial phase grows as warm air replaces the space left behind by moving the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front, intensifying the cyclonic circulation.\n3. OCCLUDED STAGE\n- In the mid-latitude cyclone\u2019s third stage,\nthe denser cold front catches up with the warm front\n. Because the warm air isn\u2019t dense enough to displace the cold air ahead of it, it shifts up and slides above the cold air in its path. This action eventually forms an occluded front, in which the wave transforms into a loop, which is narrower at its base and cuts off the supply of warm air.\n4. DISSOLVING/\nFRONTOLYSIS\nSTAGE\n- The final stage of the cyclone occurs when the loop formed by the cold front boundary surrounding the low-pressure pocket of warm air closes.\nThis cuts off the supply of warm moist air and the lifting force caused by the interaction between the cold and warm fronts\n. The loss of the convergence and uplift mechanisms cause the cyclone to dissolve, and the low pressure system gradually stabilizes.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nNear the surface, friction reduces the wind speed. This reduction will reduce the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force. The latter is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars towards the lower pressure. This wind is called surface wind.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle - towards the LOW - and, therefore,\nbe deflected to the right\ncompared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (ie. Wind at 4000 ft) => hence, the increasing crosswind from the right during approach.\nAs we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic.",

        "explanation": "The altimeter will indicate the airfield's elevation is the altimeter is set to the correct local QNH value set. In this case the correct local QNH is 993 hPa. However, the altimeter is still set to 1013.2 hPa. With this setting the altimeter indicates 1200 feet.\nThe difference between 1013 hPa and 993 hPa is\n20 hPa\n(1013 - 993), so the altimeter is set at a value 20 hPa too high.\nThis corresponds to a difference of 540 feet (20 hPa x 27 ft/hPa). If we would set the actual pressure of 993 hPa on the altimeter, we would go from a higher to a lower pressure.\nThat is why we have to deduct 540 ft from our current indication of 1200 ft =\n660 ft.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used. However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

If the collision is hard enough to overcome the surface tension between the two colliding droplets, coalescence will occur and\nresult in a new and larger single droplet. This process of cloud-droplet growth is referred to as collision-coalescence. Warm-cloud rain results when the droplets attain a sufficient size to fall to the ground.",

Please send any exam feedback you have to us via the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.\nTo start with,\njet streams do not cause cloud\n. They can sometimes be associated with cirrus clouds due to the warm and cold fronts that jet streams follow, and often the location of a jet stream coincides with the location of cirrus clouds as part of those fronts. It is not a common enough effect to be able to spot jet streams on a satellite image, though. Also, the sub-tropical and arctic jet stream are usually not over the majority of Scandinavia. The arctic jet stream is a little further North when it forms, and the sub-tropical jet stream much further South.\nSo then it is down to warm front vs cold front.\nWarm fronts are easier to spot because\nthey contain quite dense clouds\n(particularly towards the lower levels of the front) and are usually quite uniform in shape. The clouds seen in this image are\nless thick, and quite patchy/isolated in sections, leading us to believe that a\ncold front\nis present\n, particularly running up the Eastern side of Sweden. It could actually be travelling either way, but due to normal air currents we have drawn the cold front line going from West to East.\nWe are not too sure what is being indicated through Finland and across the border into Russia, as\nthe satellite image is not enough alone to work out what has caused this cloud formation\n.

These datasets are extensively utilized worldwide and provide comprehensive coverage. They serve as invaluable tools for pilots, enabling them to effectively visualize cumulonimbus clouds, turbulence, and other potential hazards during their flights.\nThe forecast for cumulonimbus clouds employs an algorithm that considers cloud coverage and precipitation intensity.\nTo accurately visualize the hazards associated with cumulonimbus clouds\n, it is essential to have specific information about the horizontal extent of the clouds and the height of the cloud tops.",

Vertical position at or above the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels (QNE). When passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when cllimbing and in terms of altitudes (QNH) when descending.\nAfter take-off, the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes (QNH set) until the Transition Altitude (TA). Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa)\nand altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels.\nPressure decreases with increasing height. Which means that when the pilot changes the altimeter setting from local QNH (1041 hPa), to a lower pressure (1013 hPa), the altimeter reading will decrease.\nAltimeter reading = TA - Pressure difference:\n1041 hPa - 1013 hPa = 28 hPa\n28 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =\n756\nft\nAltimeter reading = 11 000 ft - 756 ft =\n10 244 ft\nClosest option: 10 240 ft\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nStructural Icing\nIt builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.\nThere are 2 general types of structural icing:\nRIME ICE\nNormally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of\nlarge water droplets\nthat are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -10\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nWings that are thin or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.\n=>\nTherefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure\nWhen an aircraft is left outside on a cold, clear night, the upper surfaces of the aircraft cool by radiation to a temperature below that of the surrounding air. This is similar to how the surface of the Earth also cools very quickly in these conditions to form radiation fog.\nWhen this happens, the water vapour in the surrounding, warmer air touches the aircraft and will sublimate (the actual process is called deposition, however, EASA use the word sublimation) straight onto the freezing cold wing, forming a frost we know as hoar frost. This is shown in the picture above.\nHoar frost is common on cold mornings like in this scenario, as well as when descending into a warm, humid environment with an airframe/wings that are still below freezing temperature from being in the cruise.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA\nMicroburst\nis a localized column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm. These also move outwards by reaction from the ground. The windshear (headwind to tailwind) may be between 50 and 90 kt.\nMicrobursts are short-lived, usually lasting less than 5 minutes, and they are relatively compact, usually affecting an area of 1 to 4 km in diameter.\nFlying through a Microburst\n1. Imagine you're approaching a microburst at 80 knots. As you enter the vortex ring, you experience turbulence and a rapid increase in airspeed as you pick up a headwind. You start to climb as your performance increases.\n2. As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft.\n3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease.\n4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed. You're at a high angle-of-attack, and still descending.\n5. You encounter more turbulence as you enter the final vortex. If you haven't already hit the ground, you may begin to climb again as you exit the vortex.\n=>\nAn airplane flying through a series of horizontal vortices generated by microbursts experiences alternating updrafts and downdrafts causing pitch changes without pilot input.",

Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere.\nAs the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth\u2019s midsection. these convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear.\nThe air mass then flows outwards (both North and South), and\nfinally subsides in the subtropical high pressure zones (between 30\u00b0 - 40\u00b0N)\n, also called the\n\"horse latitudes\",\nwhere the air moves downward toward Earth\u2019s surface, forming a\nhigh pressure surface region with clear, warm weather\n.\nThe subtropical highs then cause the trade winds\n, completing the cycle within the Hadley cell of the atmosphere.\nStorms within the ITCZ will often go as high as 50 - 60 000 ft, so cannot be escaped upwards by commercial jet aircraft, and must be avoided using lateral deviations.\nFor this question then,\nthe convergence of the trade winds greatly affects the location and formation of the ITCZ\n.\nThe location of the subtropical high pressure zones\nhave a large effect also, as\nthey are the source regions for the trade winds\n(and also where the air ends up in the cycle of the Hadley cell).\nThe Easterly jet stream, also known as the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), is a significant feature in the tropical regions, especially during the summer months. It is characterized by strong easterly winds, blowing from east to west. The presence of the Easterly jet stream plays a crucial role in the formation and organization of the ITCZ.\nThe other option is nonsense (A high density of water vapour over the ocean does not cause the ITCZ).",

        "explanation": "Note: This is a very similar question to 504870. The feedback we have received was not clear enough to assume that they are only one question as different authorities can publish questions with different wording. We kindly request any further exam feedback that anyone has about these questions, thank you!\nIn flight airframe icing occurs when an aircraft flies through icing conditions.\nIcing conditions are mostly present within clouds below freezing temperature (0\u00baC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a \"supercooled\" state, in that their temperature is less than 0\u00baC, but they are still liquid. We call them\nSupercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs).\nWhen an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze,\nadhering to the airframe in the process\n. This can form icing such as\nrime ice, clear ice, or mixed ice (a mixture of the two).\nThis can occur in precipitation also\n, particularly when the air temperature or airframe is below 0\u00baC, where rain, freezing rain, or wet snow can adhere to the airframe or engines.\nIn reality, the best option here is \"dry snow\",\nas dry snow is considered to be made up of\nsolid ice crystals only\n, not any water droplets that could freeze onto the wing. Therefore,\ndry snow is very unlikely to adhere to the wing, unlike the other options.\nEven \"slush\" has a higher chance of causing airframe icing than dry snow, as the temperature will be very close to 0\u00baC in this instance, and the airframe or air temperature may be intermittently below 0\u00baC, causing ice accretion. The other two options are obviously more likely to cause ice accretion, particularly freezing rain.",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level.\nIt is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 999 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic.\nTo solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to 1013 hPa (\nthe aircraft\u2019s Indicated altitude\n).\nWe suggest that you use the following formula:\nTA = IA + 27 (Local QNH \u2013 Pressure setting)\nWhere; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate.\n6 000 ft = IA + 30 (999 - 1013)\nIA = 6 000 ft + 420 ft\nIA =\n6 420 ft\nThe aircraft is 6 420 ft \u2013 6 000 ft =\n420 ft higher than remaining traffic.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThis question refers to a phenomenon called:\nWEATHER ATTENUATION\nThe weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs.\nThe stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,\nRadar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.\nTip for avoiding shadows:\nTo accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.\nIf you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.\nIf you don\u2019t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it\u2019s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

        "explanation": "There are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots:\nTrue Altitude - The actual altitude above MSL (mean sea level).\nIndicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure.\nPressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels.\nIt also goes in this order,\nwe can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction\n(any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa)\nto find Indicated Altitude\n, and we can\nadjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction\n(temperature difference from ISA) to get our\nTrue Altitude\n.\nBoth of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True.\nIn any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question,\nthey give us a transition altitude\n(which would be an\nindicated altitude\n), and want us to\ncalculate the corresponding\npressure altitude\n(as that is what the pilot changes to whilst climbing through the transition altitude).\nThis difference requires a barometric (pressure) correction, between the QNH of 1028 hPa and the standard pressure setting of 1013 hPa.\nA good way to remember the next part is to think that\nindicated altitude is based on QNH\n, so\nwhenever QNH is high\n(higher than 1013)\n,\nindicated altitude is high\n. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard.\n==> When\nQNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude.\n==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude.\nThe amount of change is calculated using the difference in pressure multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which in this case is given as 27 ft per hPa. If it is not given, it should be assumed to be 30 ft per hPa.\n1028 - 1013 =\n15 hPa\n15 hPa\nx 27 ft/hPa =\n405 ft\nQNH is high, so Indicated Altitude is high, so\nthe Pressure Altitude is\n405 ft\nlower\nthan 6 000 ft.\n6 000 - 405 =\n5 595 ft, closest answer 5 600 ft",

The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice.\nClear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process.\nThis allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.\nThe fact that the supercooled drops spread back before freezing is especially dangerous because there is the risk of accretion of ice aft of the ice-protection equipment.",

In the atmosphere, pressure decreases as altitude increases. Now, imagine an isolated parcel of air moving vertically through the troposphere.\nAs altitude increases\n, the pressure exerted on the parcel decreases and\nthe parcel expands in volume as a result\n. In order to expand (do work), the parcel must use its internal energy to do so. As the air expands, the molecules spread out and ultimately collide less with one another\n. The work of expansion causes the air\u2019s temperature to decrease.\n=>\nIf the moist unsaturated parcel of air expands and cools to the dew point temperature - saturation will occur",

Due to the slant of the front (warm air sits over cold),\nthe jetstream is within the warm sector, but is actually overhanging the cold sector\n, so looks like it is inside the cold air when viewed from above (as we often mark the front locations due to their surface positions, but this is different from their positions up near the tropopause).\nAs\nthe weather fronts are\nbent by the depression\n, so is the polar front in general,\nas is the jetstream\nwhich follows this polar front\n.

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nStructural Icing\nIt builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.\nThere are 2 general types of structural icing:\nRIME ICE\nNormally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of\nlarge water droplets\nthat are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -10\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nWings that are thin or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils.\n=>\nTherefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets.",

These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent.\nThe warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude.\nPressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature =>\nIsobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels.\nFurthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential.\nThis is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold air pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected\n.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold air pools persists for approximately 3 days.\nLearning Objective 050.08.03.04.03: Identify cold-air drops on weather charts.\nNote: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are\n\"cold pools\"\n, but the new syllabus refers to them as\n\"cold-air drops\"\n.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation. The altimeter is set to the local QNH of 1023, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA +10\u00baC\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (+10) \u00d7 (12 000/1 000) =\n480\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nsubtracted\nfrom the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of \u00ad\u00ad\n11 520\nft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere.\nThermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by\nconvection\n. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This results in a continous circulation pattern.\nAdvection\ncan be considered the horizontal motion of air. More precisely, it is an exchange by the motion of a mass by which air is displaced.

The flight is performed maintaining a constant\nIndicated Altitude of 7 500 ft based on Point A's QNH of 1021 hPa\n(and that is all we need from Point A - elevation is irrelevant).\nIn order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way:\nIf we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 983 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure:\n1021 hPa - 983 hPa = 38 hPa\nAssume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft\n38 hPa x 27 ft =\n1026 ft\nWhich means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction\nTA = 7500 ft - 1026 ft = 6474 ft\nThe elevation at B is 1650 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 6474 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 6474 ft - 1650 ft =\n4824 ft\nNote: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude.\nIf QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.\nAlternatively, you can think of it this way:\n- You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 983 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 1650 ft AMSL.\n- Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1021 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 1650 ft + 1026 ft = 2676 ft => however, we are still on the ground.\n- We will now climb to 7500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1021). We need to climb 7500 ft - 2676 ft = 4824 ft (which is our height over the surface).\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

It moves\nNorth\nin the Northern Hemisphere Summer and South in the Northern Hemisphere\nWinter.\nThe ITCZ is subject to\nlarge\nseasonal movement overland\n,\nbut\nmuch less\nover the sea\n.\nThis is because\nwater has a much higher specific heat capacity than rock\n, so\nbuilds up and loses temperature much\nslower\nthan land does\n(about 4x slower), and the oceans have some mixing which makes the effect even stronger. This means that the \"hottest\" part of the ocean does not move much between December and June, whereas the \"hottest\" part of the land moves a long way (following The Sun). This \"hottest\" part of the surface dictates the ITCZ in that area, the\n\"thermal equator\".",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states \u2013 initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage.\nCUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE\nLifting action initiates the vertical movement of air\nBecause of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.\nThe cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.\n=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.\nMATURE STAGE\nAs the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.\nThe down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.\nWithin the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)\nAs the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.\nIt can last up to 30 min\n=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).\nDISSIPATING STAGE\nAs the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell \u2013 taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.\n=> Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n).\nEngine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected\n.\nSeveral engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions\n. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However,\nthe crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces\n. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

        "explanation": "One of the principles of thermodynamics is that\ntemperature between two points will always try to equalise\n. That is the reason that radiation fog forms on a clear night. The surface radiates heat away as infrared radiation, and therefore the surface cools down. The air in contact with the surface is now warmer than the surface, and so heat will begin to flow from the air to the surface by conduction. This takes heat energy away from the low level air, causing the temperature to drop below the dewpoint, forming fog.\nAir flowing over a cold surface does a similar thing. The warmer air flows over a colder surface, and\nheat flows by\nconduction\nfrom the air into the surface\n.\nThis cools the lower layers of air,\nand causes the overall\nELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) to decrease\n(as the lower air is already cold),\noften creating an inversion\nat the altitude where that cold air gradually returns to normal temperature.\nThe lower ELR and potential for an inversion make the air\nmore stable\n, as any air which is forced to rise (at the DALR or SALR) will then be colder than the surrounding air, so will sink again.\nThis often gives rise to advection fog, where that low level air cools below the dewpoint.",

Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off\n. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be\ndownwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud\n- the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.\nIn the case of this question,\nthe first 1000-1500 NM are completely clear of large convective active such as CBs\n, but after this, the aircraft is cruising at FL490 completely within a region of ISOL EMBD CBs with tops of FL470, and goes through regions of OCNL EMBD CBs with tops of FL500.\nThis area would be a perfect place for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture\ncarried up to the high altitudes.",

Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, so we can verify the figure shown, thank you.\nRefer to figures.\nThe jet stream is a fast moving \"ribbon\" of air in the upper troposphere, that occurs because of a large change in temperature between two air masses. Take the Polar jet stream, for instance. It happens because\nthe tropopause of the Ferrel Cell (Mid-Latitude, sub-tropical air) is higher than that of the Polar Cell (High Latitudes)\n,\ndue primarily to the higher temperature of the Ferrel cell\n. This means that there is a large pressure differential between the cells at the same true altitude. The Ferrel Cell air has higher pressure (at the same true altitude) than air in the Polar Cell. This pressure gradient force causes the wind to want to flow to the North. Due to the Coriolis effect, this then turns right and a large collection of air joins together,\nflowing from West to East\n. When this gets above 80kt, it is called a jet stream. Jet streams can be hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, but only a few thousand feet tall.\nAll Jet streams flow from West to East\n(except the Equatorial jet, which isn't a true jet stream).

However, when averaged over many years a global pattern of air movement emerges.\nThe reason we have different weather patterns is all because of the global atmospheric circulation caused by the rotation of the Earth and the amount of heat different parts of the globe receive.\nThe sun is our main source of heat, and because of the tilt of the Earth, its curvature, our atmosphere, clouds and polar ice and snow, different parts of the world heat up differently. The change in angle leads to stronger insolation on the Northern Hemisphere from April to September, and stronger insolation on the Southern Hemisphere from October to March. Thus, different pressure areas which trigger a large circulation between the equator and the poles are formed. Because of the Earth\u00b4s rotation, a direct flow between anticyclone (equator) and depression (poles) is prevented.\nIn the Northern hemisphere, the air masses are deflected to the right and in the Southern hemisphere to the left. For that reason, three large circulation cells are generated (Hadley cell, Ferrel cell and the Polar cell).",

Although it often forms 50 to 200 miles ahead of a fast-moving\ncold front\n, the existence of a front is not necessary for a squall line to form.\nObviously, with so many thunderstorms,\nthe weather around a squall line can be very bad\n. This includes widespread turbulence, of course moderate to severe inside the clouds themselves, but also\nsome intense clear air turbulence (CAT) around, above, and underneath the squall line.\nSquall lines should be avoided by an even larger margin than isolated CBs.\nAs for the other answers:\nIn a cold occlusion, there is usually turbulence within the clouds and precipitation, but not always clear air turbulence around (it very much depends on the altitude you fly through it, and the conditions of the day), whereas squall lines always contain many CBs so definitely do provide some CAT.\nA warm high would be a stable portion of air, so unlikely to provide much turbulence at all.\nWith calm winds (no sea breeze, etc), a coastline could cause some turbulence due to changing thermals between land and sea, but it wouldn't usually be much, and certainly not as much as around a squall line.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope\n\u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst\non the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nWith regards to this question\n, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds.\nThe north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer => little or no precipitation is expected.",

It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction. It creates a very small (a few hundred meters maximum),\nextremely low pressure zone\n, with air circulating around it at incredibly high speeds, in the region of 200 kt.\nTornadoes start as funnel clouds, extending downwards from the base of the thunderstorm, eventually reaching the ground and causing incredible destruction in some cases. The cores only move at around 10-20kt, but the wind speed around the core can reach over 200 kt. The\ncircular air motion\nis key, as the air begins to \"orbit\" the core, getting continuously sucked inwards but missing the centre, so ending up circling the core.\nThe other answers are referring to different meteorological phenomena, such as cloud formation (temperature close to dew point), tropical revolving storms (need a sea temperature of 26.5\u00b0C) and dust devils (small tornado style winds that pick up the dust off the ground).",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nHUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air.\nHumidity Measurement\nAbsolute Humidity\nRefers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3\nSaturation Mixing Ratio (SMR)\nMaximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature.\nHumidity Mixing Ratio (HMR)\nThe ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel.\nExpressed as g/kg of dry air.\nRelative Humidity (RH)\nThe ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.\nDepends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.\nRH = (HMR/SMR) x 100\nRH 100% = Saturation\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature.\nIn simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.\nFrom the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.\nRelative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand,\nsince colder air doesn\u2019t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases\n(provided that moisture content remains unchanged).",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nDuring the Summer months\n(June, July, August), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) follows the Sun Northwards away from the Equator. As a result, the\nSE trade winds\noriginating from the Southern Hemisphere undergo a change in direction as they cross the geographic Equator and enter the Northern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right slightly in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become the South-Westerly monsoons. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.\nIn the context of\nIndia\n, the SW monsoon brings humid maritime air from the Indian Ocean. It hits the West coast of India directly, but does still affect the Eastern edge of India, as\nthe heat of the Indian landmass effectively \"pulls in\" the air from the Bay of Bengal to the East\n, so\non the Eastern side of India, the wind is more Southerly than South-Westerly.\nD\nuring the Winter months\n(December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the cooler air from the Siberian peninsula flows over the Indian subcontinent from the NE, called the NE monsoon. It is much drier and cooler than the SW monsoon.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTemperature inversions\ninhibit vertical mixing, resulting in light winds below the inversion layer and relatively strong winds just above it. This contrast in wind speeds\ncreates wind shear\n, which can lead to airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft ascends or descends through the inversion.\nIt's important to note that at the top of the inversion, the wind direction can shift by as much as 90\u00ba, and the wind speed can increase by up to 40 knots.\nAdditionally, aircraft performance is closely tied to density altitude, with temperature playing a crucial role. As temperature rises, density altitude increases, causing the air to become less dense. This, in turn, affects engine and wing performance. When climbing through an inversion, the temperature rises with altitude, resulting in\nreduced aircraft performance\n. This decrease in performance leads to lower thrust and lift as the aircraft enters warmer and less dense air.",

Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black.\nInfrared imagery\nis produced by sensing the emitted radiation coming off of clouds. The temperature of the cloud will determine the wavelength of radiation emitted from the cloud.\nInfrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night.\nCold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image.\nWith regards to this question\n, note that this is a night flight.

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nMONSOONS\nA monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter\n\u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south.\nWinds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air\n. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer\n\u2013 June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon.\nThis Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture\n, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).\n=> As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 979 hPa = 34 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 34 ft x 30 ft/hPa = \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad1 020 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 1 020 ft =\n3 980 ft\n.\nTo determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad+11.8\u00baC. The actual outside air temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-10 \u00baC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA\n-21.8\u00baC\n.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -21.8\u00baC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 980 ft - 1 600 ft = 2 318 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-21.8) \u00d7 (2 380/1000) =\n-207 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n3 773 ft\n.\nTherefore, the height above ground = 3 773 ft - 2 320 ft =\n1 453 ft\n(1470 ft is the closest option).\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

As yet we do not have quite enough information to put anything together for that other question. If anyone sees either questions in their exams, please inform us in the comments, or alternatively, you can email your feedback to info@atplquestions.com or put it in the \"question feedback\" section of your dashboard, thank you!\nRVR is a special measure of visibility in the direction of the runway\n. As prevailing visibility is usually used, which is approximately the average visibility in all directions from the station, this can be a bit inaccurate, as the visibility can vary massively between two different directions, due to different density of obscuration, perhaps.\nThis is why, when the visibility is below 1500 m, the RVR is reported also, as the RVR (Runway Visual Range) is a measure of the exact visibility directly down the runway, and usually is measured at 3 different places on the runway, touchdown zone, midpoint, and stop-end.\nThis is almost always\nhigher than the prevailing visibility\n, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers).\nIn terms of this question, the\nrunway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of\ncentreline markings or lights\nthat can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so those two answers must be correct. Also, the next closest answer is the\nrunway edge lights\n, which you should be able to see also. The other options are either to the side of the runway (in a direction where visibility is not assured), or behind the aircraft when lined up.\nAgain, we are not sure about some of the options here, due to lack of feedback.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThere are a few different types of ice that can form on an aircraft in flight. The two most common are rime ice and clear ice.\nRIME ICE\nRime ice is an\nopaque, cloudy type of ice\nbuild up that\nusually\naccretes on leading edges, such as the aircraft nose, wing/tail leading edges, etc. It is opaque due to the air trapped inside the ice;\nthis makes it very difficult to see through.\nIt is normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nCLEAR ICE\nAs you can expect from the name, clear ice is a transparent, layered form of icing, which usually runs backwards over the airframe or the wing. It is more dangerous than rime ice as it affects the aerodynamic shape of the wing more, and allows a larger ice build up, which adds weight and drag. It can also run backwards over control surfaces, freezing them in place.\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -10\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice would be much easier to see through if accreted on a windshield than the cloudy rime ice.\nThe other types of icing that can be encountered in flight are mixed ice (a mixture of rime and clear ice) and ice crystal icing (a much rarer formation inside engines and pitot tubes from tiny ice crystals above large storms - looks like rain on a heated windshield - bounces off unheated surfaces)",

Imagine standing with your back into the wind, so facing South.\nThe low-pressure area would be on your left side (this is also the side the aircraft is coming from).\nAnd the high-pressure area would be on your right. We know that if we fly from a low to a high-pressure area the true altitude increase.\nIf the QNH in an area changes, we have to think about what consequence this has on our flight.\nSince we fly on a Flight level (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don\u2019t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change.\nBut our actual flight level will. Because the altimeter is only accurate in the Standard Atmosphere and we now are experiencing a higher actual pressure, the altimeter will\nunder read\n.\nThe actual altitude will be higher.\nRemember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below!\nThis is correct for both pressure and temperature.",

The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice. Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the cold airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process.\nIn a matter of seconds, freezing rain can coat an entire airplane, ruin lift, increase weight, block air filters, and render your windshield useless (\npilot's visibility may be significantly reduced\n).

Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers,\nWeather associated with Low Pressure Systems:\n- CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause\n- PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression.\n- VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air\n- TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year.

To calculate whether the aircraft has gained or lost altitude, we can use the rhyme:\n\"High to Low, Beware Below\"\nMeaning that if flying from high to low pressure, the actual altitude is reducing (if we don't change the altimeter subscale.\nWe are flying from low to high\n, so have the opposite issue;\nwe are getting higher\n.\nThe amount can be easily calculated by multiplying the pressure change by\n27 ft/hPa (given in the question\n, if not give, use 30 ft/hPa)\nAltitude increase = (1016 - 968) x 27 = 48 x 27 =\n1 296 ft\nThis means the new altitude is 5 500 + 1 296 =\n6 796 ft\nHowever, the question asks us for our height, which is measured above ground level (agl). We therefore just remove the elevation of the ground from 6 796 ft.\nHeight (agl) = 6 796 - 650 =\n6 146 ft",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at 8 254 ft\n(6 254 + 2 000).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA +24\u00baC\n. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 254 ft - 3 100 ft =\n5 154 ft\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (+24) \u00d7 (5 154/1000) =\n495\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nsubtracted from\nthe true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad7 759 ft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa =\n22 hPa\n. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:\nPressure correction\n= 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =\n660 ft\n. This value needs to be\nadded\nto the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 7 759 ft + 660 ft =\n8 419 ft\n.\nAs flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 8 419 ft, which is\nFL85\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "correct_answer": "SE to SW.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nDuring the summer months\n(June, July, August), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) tends to shift away from the Equator and move further northward. As a result, the\nSE trade winds\noriginating from the Southern Hemisphere undergo a change in direction as they cross the geographic Equator and enter the Northern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become\nSW monsoons\n. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In the context of\nIndia\n, these SW monsoons bring humid maritime air.\nConversely,\nduring the winter months\n(December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the NE trade winds from the Northern Hemisphere need to cross the geographic Equator to reach the ITCZ. Upon entering the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects these winds to the left, resulting in a change in their direction from NE to NW. Consequently, the Southern Hemisphere experiences NW monsoons, particularly in southern parts of Africa, while the Northern Hemisphere encounters NE monsoons in regions that previously experienced SW monsoons during the summer months (such as parts of Africa and India). Using India as an example, these NE monsoons bring dry continental air.",

The small amount of evaporation from the sea is enough to cause saturation and condensation.\nSteam fog is typically up to 500 feet thick and may drift inland. The fog can be persistent and up to 500 feet thick - may drift inland.\nWill be dispersed by an increase in wind speed or change of direction.\nNote: Formation of Steaming Fog is mainly dependant on the difference bwteen air temperature and water temperature => The trick here is to find the biggest difference between these 2 temperatures.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC.\nHowever,\nyou can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC\n. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

        "correct_answer": "FL75",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at 5 860 ft\n(3 860 + 2 000).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nTo compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude of 36 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC. The actual temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-2\u00baC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -\n17\u00baC.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -17\u00baC\n. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 5 860 ft - 36 ft = 5 824 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-17) \u00d7 (5 824/1000) =\n-396\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded to\nthe true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\n6 256 ft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 972 hPa = 41 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 41 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 1 230 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 6 256 ft + 1 230 ft =\n7 486\nft\n.\nThe lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is\nFL75\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "correct_answer": "(1) convergence, (2) lifting, (3) cumuliform clouds or squalls.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLet's break down the components of the statement:\n(1)\nConvergence\n: Convergence refers to the coming together or convergence of air masses. In the context of a trough, it indicates that air is flowing toward the trough axis from different directions and meeting at that point.\n(2)\nLifting\n: Lifting refers to the upward movement of air. In the presence of convergence, the air is forced to rise along the trough axis. This lifting motion can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation.\n(3)\nCumuliform clouds or squalls\n: Cumuliform clouds are large, puffy clouds with a vertical development, often associated with convection. Squalls are intense, localized storms characterized by strong winds and heavy precipitation. Along the line of the trough, the convergence and lifting can result in the formation of cumuliform clouds or trigger squall-like weather conditions.\nDetailed explanation:\nA\ntrough\nis an extension of a low-pressure system. It is an area indicated by isobars that extend outwards from an area of low Pressure (typically forming a \u201cV\u201d shaped pattern). Troughs are very often associated with the fronts of polar front depressions. The weather associated with a trough will be similar to that of a depression.\nWeather associated with a Trough:\nCLOUD\n:\nextensive\nand may extend from low altitude to the tropopause\nPRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression.\nVISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air.\nTEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air.\nWINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTroposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level.\nNearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here.\nWith increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases.\nStratosphere\n=\nThe layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere\n, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground.\nWith increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence.\nThis is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere.\nThe lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the\ntropopause;\nthe upper boundary is called the stratopause.\nThe\nozone layer\nor ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation.\nIt contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.\nT\nhe ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere\n, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically.\nIn case of this specific question:\nBecause ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature here increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere.\nCold air is more dense than warm air.\nIf a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable\n,\nand there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom.\nStability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate):\nAbsolute stability\n: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up.ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8\u00b0C per 1 000 ft (0.6\u00b0C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR.\nAbsolute instability\n: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings.ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3\u00b0C per 1 000 ft (1\u00b0C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR.\nConditional instability\n: ELR is between 1.8\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR.\nELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude).\nThis layer is considered\nturbulence free\nbecause the warm air over the cold air mass acts like a cap,\npreventing vertical mixing\nand thus leads to a stable atmosphere.",

That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. As we fly through the front, this is a change in direction in the anti-clockwise sense (known as \"backing\"),\nfrom approximately 280\u00b0 (NW) to approximately 230\u00b0(\nSW\n).\nThe isobars are also closer together after the second cold front\n, meaning that the\nwind speed is higher\nin this region, and therefore\nthe wind gets faster\nafter passing through the cold front.\nThe cold front is moving from West to East in the diagram, as is expected with a front in this region (and shown by the direction of the \"spikes\" on the front. This means that \"in front\" of the cold front is the Eastern side of it, and \"behind\" the cold front is the Western side.\nOur track means that we \"overtake\" the front, starting behind it and passing through it to end up in front of it.\nNote: this is a variation on question 507036 which has been fed back to us.

Ozone is found primarily in two regions of the atmosphere. About 10% of atmospheric ozone is in the troposphere, the region closest to Earth (from the surface up to about 10\u201316 kilometres).

        "correct_answer": "Freezing rain.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFreezing Rain can cause significant accumulations\nof clear ice.\nClear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing\n. The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nClear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice.\nFreezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0\u00b0C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0\u00b0C.\n\"Snow\" INCORRECT. Snow is solid precipitation in the form of ice crystals. Remember that for airframe icing to form water must be present in liquid state.\n\"Cirrus Clouds\" INCORRECT.\nYou are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.",

For Western Europe, the air masses are classified as\nT(Tropical), P(Polar) and A(Arctic)\n- in terms of their thermal qualities - and\nc(continental) or m(maritime)\n- in terms of their water content. Note that Artic air is from directly North of Europe, whereas Polar air is from the Polar cell fo the atmosphere, so source regions like Siberia or Northern Canada/Greenland.\nThe Polar front splits Sub-tropical air (which we refer to as Tropical for European air masses) from Polar air. Therefore, when a Polar front depression forms (in the North Atlantic specifically), the warm sector to the South of the depression is that Tropical air, whereas the rest of the depression is surrounded by the Polar air. Therefore, in this question;\n(1) is\nTropical\nair in the warm sector,\n(2) is\nPolar\nair ahead of the depression (East), and\n(3) is the\nPolar\nair behind the depression (West).\n(4) is a little more complicated. It is the air North of the depression. From the options, we have already narrowed down the correct answer, and that states that the air North of the depression \"may be\"\nArctic\n.\nThis is not always the case, but certainly possible, especially in Winter\nwhen Artic air can easily flow down from the North Pole. Often, for a new depression, this air would also be Polar, but later down the life cycle, it can drag Artic air down to it. Also, the question says\n\"may be\", rather than \"is\"\n, which we are happy to consider as being correct.",

The 0\u00baC level in sector \"B\" is between 4 000 ft and 6 000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0\u2070C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case. Also, NASA quotes ice as being worst between +2\u2070C and -20\u2070C, so we know it can happen in low positive temperatures.\nThe aircraft cannot therefore avoid icing conditions on that route at any of the given levels.\nNote: There is some debate over whether the aircraft could remain outside of icing conditions at 3 500 ft, as that is lower than the 0\u00baC isotherm in the B region, however, the CU/SC cloud that would be encountered does include moderate icing and turbulence, and icing can occur just above 0\u00baC, so we are agreeing with the most recent feedback that 3500 ft would not be able to avoid moderate icing. Further feedback is still required to verify this though.",

Hoar frost occurs in clear air.\nWater vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating).\nThis whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus \u2013 their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles).\nHoar frost is not as dangerous as clear ice\nbut may affect the lift characteristics of the wings\n. If frost is not removed from the wings, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.",

Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.\nThe cloud will reach the mature stage in about 15-20 minutes.\n=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts. The cloud is a\ntowering cumulus\nduring this stage\nMATURE STAGE\nAs the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.\nThe down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.\nWithin the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)\nAs the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.\nIt can last up to 30 minutes (in a single cell).\n=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).\nDISSIPATING STAGE\nAs the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell \u2013 taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.\n=> Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

The given information specifies the height at the QFE setting, and the question is asking for the true height. As per the given question, the aircraft is currently flying at an height of 2 000 ft (while the altimeter subscale is set to airfield QFE). This setting indicates that the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the elevation of the airfield.\nWe need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12\u00baC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the aircraft and the airfield elevation will be taken into account: 2 000 ft (the aerodrome which is located 1000 ft AMSL but the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the airfield). Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-12) \u00d7 (2 000/1 000) = -\n96 f\nt.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true height of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n1 904 ft\n.",

        "explanation": "True Altitude is the real distance beneath the aircraft to the ground\n. The TA depends on the mean temperature of the layer of air between the reference pressure surface and the static pressure surface (level of the aircraft) and on the pressure.\nFor pressure correction, we apply a correction of 30 ft for each 1 hPa difference between the QNH and the standard 1013 hPa. If the actual QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than indicated altitude. If the QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, then true altitude is higher than indicated\nThe same logic can be used to answer this question. When flying into a high pressure area, the pressure (local QNH) will be increasing. Thus,\ntrue altitude will increase\n.\nIn such questions it might help if you remember that turning the knob of the altimeter clockwise (right), the subscale indication increases and also the altitude indication increases (needle turning right).",

We do not yet know if the questions and options are the same, or if the wordings are different, and we believe there may be two questions present, perhaps by different authorities. Nonetheless, the answer should be the same, as the scenario is almost exactly the same. Please let us know if you see these in the exam, and anything you can remember about the question(s) that you see, thank you!\nIf an indication of a temperature inversion is given as part of an ATIS, it means that it is quite a noticeable inversion.\nInversions occur when the air gets warmer with increased altitude\n, so when warmer air is above colder air. This can happen for many reasons, due to night cooling, valley inversions, frontal activity, etc.\nAn inversion is incredibly stable, meaning that there is very little vertical movement of air through the inversion. This means that\nlittle to no mixing occurs\n, and therefore, the wind velocity (speed and direction) below the inversion may be totally different from the wind velocity above the inversion, and the difference may happen over a very small band of altitude.\nThis means that flying through an inversion has the potential for quite significant vertical wind shear (changing wind velocity with changing altitude).\nThis is why information about them are passed to pilots, so they can expect the wind shear and make decisions based on it.\nInversions can also have large effects on aircraft performance, and the aircraft performance will be better below the inversion in the colder air.\nTo look at the options:\n\"The possibility for a sudden reduction in visibility due to the blowing snow.\"\nThe ATIS made no mention of snow.\n\"A sudden degradation of braking performance on the runway.\"\nThe ATIS said nothing about a wet or contaminated runway, braking performance might be perfectly fine. The low air temperature has the opportunity to form ice from any moisture, but if the ground if dry then the traction should not be much less than normal.\n\"Possibility for low-altitude wind shear.\"\nCorrect. As mentioned above, the inversion may cause wind shear at low levels when passing through it.\n\"The altimeter will over-read the aerodrome elevation.\"\nThis is not necessarily correct, as\nif\nthe QNH pressure is set at aerodrome elevation\n, the altimeter will read the correct altitude when on the ground\n. The air is very cold so some temperature errors will exist when flying around, but as mentioned above, not if using QNH. This is because the QNH is measured at the aerodrome elevation specifically so the elevation will show on aircraft altimeters when they are on the ground.",

This occurs due to a\nsurface high pressure region (anticyclone).\nThis excess air that flows outwards must come from somewhere though, and it arrives from above,\nflowing down\ninto the high pressure region in\na process called subsidence\n. This subsidence causes clear weather conditions, as no air is rising (which would form clouds), instead\nall the air is sinking\n, and warming at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate). This makes the sinking air quite warm when it gets close to the ground, and\noften a high pressure\ninversion\nwill form\n, with haze trapped underneath.\nThe further we go back in the process, though, we can see that the air above the surface high pressure region must feed it with that air somehow, and that comes from air flowing inwards\nat the top of the troposphere (just under the tropopause)\n, which is called things like \"\nconvergence aloft\", \"high altitude convergence\", etc\n., they all mean the same thing. Effectively, there is a low pressure region at high altitude which takes in the air to feed the high pressure region at low altitude.",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "perpendicular to the isobars.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nPressure patterns in the atmosphere dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, in a low pressure area, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force.\nThe coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means\nthat air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force.\nThis makes it\nvery difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving\n. There is, however,\nsome air that manages to escape a high pressure zone\n, and\nsome air which enters a low pressure zone\n. This\nmostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more\n.\nThe outflow of air from a high is called divergence\n. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days.\nThe inflow of air into a low is called convergence\n. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather.\nIn this question, they are asking about\nthe atmospheric divergence, assumably from a high pressure zone\n. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel\nacross the isobars\nand\naway from the high pressure area\n,\ntowards the low. This means that there is\na component of the wind that is blowing\nperpendicular to the isobars,\nand this is the component of divergence.\nThe options mention the friction layer. The friction layer is a layer of air above the ground, within which the wind is affected by friction with the surface, also called the boundary layer. Inside this layer, the air is slowed down more by friction, and the coriolis force is therefore not as strong, so some divergence/convergence can occur. The options mentioning it are not correct though.",

        "explanation": "The temperature lapse rate of air is the amount of temperature change the air experiences over a difference in height. There are a different lapse rates, depending on the situation.\nThis question is simply asking about the SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate)\nDALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate)\n- This is the amount of temperature that dry (non-saturated) air changes by\nif it rises or sinks in the atmosphere\n. Adiabatic means that no external temperatures affect it, and any parcel of dry air will conform to this DALR if moved up or down. The DALR is -3\u00baC/1000ft, meaning that for every 1 000 ft gained, a dry parcel of air will reduce in temperature by 3\u00baC. This happens because air rises into lower pressure, therefore expanding and making the molecules further apart, so less collisions occur and less heat is present.\nSALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate)\n- This is the same concept as for the DALR, but has an added layer of complication. When saturated (Relative Humidity 100%) air rises, it will become cooler (as is standard due to expansion), but that means that\nthe air can no longer hold as much water, so some water is released as condensation\n, turning into liquid water droplets. This process is going from a high energy state (water vapour) to a lower energy state (liquid), meaning that\nlatent heat is released\n(see annex above).\nThe release of latent heat\nadds temperature to the air\n, which gains back a little of the 3\u00baC lost per 1 000 ft (DALR). This means that\nsaturated air does not lose heat as quickly with altitude as dry air does\n, but by how much depends on the heat of the air (and therefore the water content. More water to condense means that more energy is put into the atmosphere, so the air cools less, so\nthe wetter air cools slower with altitude increase\n).\nFor standard temperatures we say that the SALR is about\n-1.8\u00baC/1000ft\n, meaning that the water condensation releases 1.8\u00baC into the atmosphere every 1 000 ft.\nSometimes lapse rates are measured in degrees (\u00baC) per 100 m, in which case, the DALR would be -1\u00baC/100m and\nthe SALR would be -0.6\u00baC/100m on average\n(remember, the SALR can change).\nELR (Environmental Lapse Rate)\n- This is the\nACTUAL\nchange in temperature throughout the atmosphere, measured by a radiosonde. The ELR decides whether pockets of air that moves upwards or downwards will be unstable or stable, as the ELR dictates what the moving air will have to compare its temperature to (read up on stability for more explanation).",

Drifting snow and\nBlowing snow can further reduce the visibility to a minimum of 1 m\n.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCOLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL\nA cold air pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nAs a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold air pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kts, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas.\nTropical revolving storms only form in certain conditions:\nMust be within 5 and 25 latitude\n(Below 5\u00ba, Coriolis force is too small, above 25\u00ba latitude the sea is usually too cold)\nOcean temperatures must be greater than 26\u00b0C. The higher the ocean temperature the greater the pressure drop within the core => This is the reason why we do not usually have TRS forming in the southern Atlantic because the sea surface temperatures are too low.\nSufficiently unstable atmosphere at low level (so convective clouds penetrate the Trade wind inversion).\nDirection of Movement\nAfter a Tropical Revolving Storm forms,\nthey usually travel Westerly\n(from east to west), in the Northern Hemisphere. In the mature stage,\nthey usually head to Northerly directions\nin the Northern Hemisphere.

Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.\nThe denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.\nThe slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.\nCold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front.\nPrecipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 \u2013 185 km) \u2013 mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.\nA winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.\nClouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns.\n- Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation.\n- An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.\nNOTE\n:\nCumulus clouds are the most common\ncloud types that are produced by cold fronts. They often grow into cumulonimbus clouds, which produce thunderstorms.\nCold fronts can also produce nimbostratus, stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.",

Due to this subsiding air, there are\nvery few clouds within the high pressure area\n, but high pressure can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath. CBs can form due to thermal uplift in the afternoon, but this is made more difficult by the subsiding air. Ridges actually can move and change shape faster than a standard anticyclone, whilst having almost the same weather, so they are\nwell known for their fine weather.",

They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale.\nHow does a Valley Inversion form?\nThe temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation.\nConsequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.\nThus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

        "explanation": "The amount of water vapor at saturation increases exponentially with an increase in temperature.\nIn a constant pressure environment, the amount of water vapor, measured in grams per kilogram of dry air, known as the saturated mixing ratio, exhibits a relationship with temperature. As the temperature rises, the saturated mixing ratio increases, while it decreases with a reduction in temperature.\nDuring the day, as the temperature increases, the relative humidity (RH) tends to decrease. This is because\nwarmer air has a higher capacity to hold moisture\n, allowing it to accommodate a larger amount of water vapor.\nHowever, as the day progresses and reaches around 1500 hrs, the temperature starts to decrease. As the temperature drops, the air's capacity to hold water vapor also decreases. This leads to an increase in the relative humidity during the evening and night hours. The higher relative humidity at night is particularly significant during autumn and winter when mist and fog tend to form after dark.\nThe rising RH during the night is a result of the reduced temperature and the limited ability of the air to hold water vapor. When the air reaches its saturation point, excess moisture condenses, forming mist or fog.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThe figure shows a warm front followed by a cold front, a cross section of a very common polar front depression (travelling low). We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front.\nIn the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain.\nLocation 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties.\nLocation 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds.\nAt location 3\n, once the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much\ndependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass\n. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have\nstable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the winter\n.\nThis would line up with the METAR in the question.\nAt location 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain and heavy rain ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form.\nThe lack of heavy rain is the biggest indicator that it is NOT location 1, where heavy rain is pretty much garaunteed.",

        "explanation": "FEW CONSIDERATIONS:\nFirstly, it is important to point out that this is a Contour chart and pressure information is not provided - Pressure is constant everywhere\n=> this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations).\nIsohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed) ,then we can assume a low pressure.\nHaving that established,\u00a0it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts.\nThe closer the contours the stronger the wind.\nCirculation of air around a High and Low Pressure system:\nIn the Northern Hemisphere:\n-\u00a0The\u00a0air\u00a0moves anticlockwise\u00a0around a low pressure\u00a0centre; and\n- Clockwise\u00a0around a high pressure\u00a0centre.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere:\n-\nThe\u00a0air\u00a0moves clockwise\u00a0around a low pressure\u00a0centre;\nand\n- Anticlockwise\u00a0around a high pressure\u00a0centre.\nWith regards to this question\n,\nWe can see that this question depicts a situation in the Southern Hemisphere, in Melbourne.\nNow,\u00a0notice the wind arrow on the upper left side of \"A\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from Southwest - Northeast, therefore indicating an clockwise direction =>\nwhich means that both are low pressure areas.\nThe tighter packed Isohypses show lower elevations\n,\nwider spaced isohypses show higher elevations\n=> by looking at the isohypses, we can see that the\u00a0contours at \"A\" are closer than at \"B\", therefore\ntrue altitude is higher over \"B\" than \"A\"\n.",

They are the same so any explanations are interchangeable.\nCOLD-AIR DROP\n/COLD POOL\nA cold-air drop is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposphere - it\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nThey are formed when\ncold air aloft breaks away from the polar region,\nmaking its way South (in the Northern Hemisphere), past the\nPolar front.\nThey are not linked to mountains, so that option is not correct. The other options are easy to discount.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFOEHN EFFECT\nFoehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes\nof nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and\nprecipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes.\nBy the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze\n.\nBecause it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds\nor in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(\nLarge supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

Measured in knots/1 000 ft.\nVertical wind shear\n- A change in speed and/or direction with change of height.\nMeasured in knots/100 ft.",

        "explanation": "LLWAS (Low-Level Wind Shear Alert System) has wind sensors (anemometers) that are\nclose enough together that they should measure quite similar wind directions and speeds\n. This makes it easy to tell if there is significant wind shear present, such as in this case.\nIt is not clear whether this is a vertical wind shear (the wind at 150 ft is significantly faster than the wind at 60 ft), or if it is horizontal wind shear (the wind is much stronger to the NE of the airfield), but in reality it does not matter. A difference of wind speed of 12 kts between two relatively close sensors is a large indicator that wind shear is present, which is often caused by local weather systems such as thunderstorms, microbursts, etc.\nThe\ndowndrafts from a thunderstorm/microburst\nhit the ground with a large amount of speed, then\nspreading out sideways\n, causing strong squalls of wind that are extremely localised, meaning that they can arrive and disappear very quickly, causing\nsignificant change to an aircraft's air speed.\nNone of the other answers could reasonably cause such strong differences in wind speed so close together.",

Additionally, \"NSC\" indicates that there are no significant clouds. The wind direction is 220\u00ba at 5 KT. The temperature and dew point are both reported as 03/03, which indicated high relative humidity.\nFog is indicated in the METAR as \"FG\" when\nvisibility is less than 1 000\nmeters due to water droplets. It is most commonly radiation fog, formed through ground cooling at night. Radiation fog typically has a\nshallow vertical extent\n,\nup to a few hundred feet\n. It requires a\nclear sky\n, high relative humidity, and\nlight wind (2-8 knots)\nto form.

Warm air replacing cold air.\nThe warm air is forced to rise over the cold air\nas part of slowly pushing the cold air out of the way\nConditions associated with a cold front:\nSurface winds\n: A change in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of any front.\nBefore the front arrives,\nwinds ahead of the front (in the colder air mass)\nare typically from the South/South-West, but once the front passes through, winds usually\nveer\naround, and come from the West/South-West\n(in the warmer air mass).\nThe wind veering actually tells us nothing, as all standard Northern Hemisphere fronts cause the wind to veer.\nTemperature\n: steady before the front. An increase is usually observed at the front. Behind the warm front, it is steady again.\nPressure\n:\nAs the front approaches, the pressure gradually decreases\n. Then once the front passes,\nthe pressure should remain constant, at the lowest pressure value\n(whilst within the warm sector).\nClouds\n: As a warm front approaches, the clouds can be expected to begin at high levels about 500 nm ahead of the front, gradually reducing to the ground as the front passes. In stable air, you can expect Cs, Ci, As, Ns, St and some frontal fog.\nIn unstable air, the rising warm air can trigger convective activity, such as Cu or\nCb\n, with a good chance of the\nCBs being embedded in the surrounding clouds\n(as mentioned in this question).\nPrecipitation\n: Heavy rain can be expected ahead of the front. Thunderstorms can occur if the airmass is unstable. The rain tends to turn into drizzle as the front passes.\nVisibility\n:\nGenerally poor, due to the potential for fog and drizzle\n, but this can vary quite a lot depending on the air masses involved.\n=> The real indicators in this question are the\npressure (stops reducing)\n, meaning a warm front\n, and the\nembedded CBs\nmeaning unstable air.",

        "explanation": "LIGHTNING\nAs a towering cumulus develops, a large electrical charge separation builds up within the cloud. Lighting results when this electrical charge becomes strong enough to jump from the cloud to the ground, to another cloud, or to an opposite electrical charge within the same cloud.\nIn the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.\nTypes of lightning:\nIntra-Cloud lightning:\nThe most common type of lightning. It happens inside the cloud, jumping between different charge regions in the cloud. It lights up the cloud.\nCloud-to-air lightning:\nReferring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud.\nCloud-to-cloud lightning:\nHappens when a negatively charged cloud finds a positively charged cloud and opposites attract. The discharge travels from cloud to cloud.\nCloud-to-ground lightning:\nFlows from the cloud to the ground. Often has downward \"branches\" or \"forks\" which come off at angles and discharge into the surrounding air.\nGround-to-cloud lightning:\nAlso known as upward lightning, and has the opposite direction of charge from the cloud-to-ground lightning above. The lightning flows upwards, and may have a few small upwards branches, but is mostly made up of just one path.\nThis image is good enough to see that the lightning is\ncloud-to-air\n, as it comes out of the cloud in the very bright region, and the forks spread out and disappear into the air,\nnot going into any other clouds\n.",

It is a type of cumulus cloud that is tall and large, often associated with thunderstorms.\nTCU indicates the presence of \u2018thermals\u2019, and may grow into Cb if conditions are right.\nOne of the key differences in appearance between a towering cumulus and a cumulonimbus cloud is the size. A\ntowering cumulus cloud is a large, white, fluffy cloud that can reach great heights, but it is not as tall and wide as a cumulonimbus cloud.\nAnother difference is that a cumulonimbus cloud often has an anvil-shaped top, which is caused by the cloud reaching the upper limit of the troposphere and the winds spreading the top of the cloud out horizontally. Also, cumulonimbus clouds are more likely to produce thunderstorm and lightning than towering cumulus clouds.",

It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10\u00b0C and -10\u00b0C.\nLightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory.\nThis happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.\nWhile flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge\nThe main effects of a lightning strike are:\nTemporary blindness of the pilots\nMinor airframe damage\nMagnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked\nDisruption to electrical equipment",

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water.\nIce crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds\n. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface.\nThus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow.\nWhether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

For this to happen,\nthe parcel of air must be saturated\n=> unable to hold all the water it contains in vapour form, so it starts to condense into a liquid or solid form. The height at which this occurs is called the condensation level - it is also the height of the cloud base. The condensation level is the height at which the rising air, cooling adiabatically, has cooled to the dew point temperature. Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the formation of cloud.\nThere are two ways by which saturation is reached.\n(a) By increasing the water content in the air, e.g. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more.\n(b) By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation occurs, and is unable to 'hold' any more water.\n=> Therefore, we can conclude that 2 unsaturated parcels of air will form a cloud when they cool down to the dew point temperature, becoming saturated => and condensation starts.",

Cold pools aloft are frequently associated with deep atmospheric instability, often leading to severe weather conditions.\nIt's important to note that numerical weather prediction models struggle to precisely predict the movement direction of cold air drops\n. These features are not discernible on low-level surface charts but are instead identified by the lower contour (isohypse) heights depicted on 500 hPa charts and above. On average, a cold air drop tends to persist for approximately 2-3 days.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze\n.\nBecause it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large supercooled water droplets that are found in cumuliform clouds\nor in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(\nLarge supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds\n)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

Positive charge is typically transferred towards the storm top and negative charge accumulates towards the bottom. Positive charge in the storm top flows upwards into the ionosphere, causing it to gain a net positive charge. At the same time, negative charge from the base of the storm is transferred down to Earth\u2019s surface in lightning and negatively charged rain.\nThus thunderstorms actively transport charge, generating a large potential difference (voltage) between the ionosphere and Earth\u2019s surface.\nIf the global thunderstorm generator was suddenly switched off, and all thunderstorms stopped, the ionosphere would slowly discharge.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nWhen air encounters a high ridge of terrain, it is compelled to ascend. This upward motion, especially in unstable atmospheric conditions, can give rise to the formation of Cumulus (Cu) or Cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds and potentially trigger thunderstorms, provided there is an ample amount of water vapor present. Strong winds combined with moist air can induce convective instability, leading to the development of Cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms.\nIn regions characterized by rugged topography, this uplifting process can become quite vigorous, resulting in the generation of extensive cloud cover and vertical growth due to convective instability. Moreover, this can enhance the intensity of precipitation.\nThe orographic lift phenomenon\namplifies the concentration and size of Supercooled Large Droplets\n(SLD), thus flying through orographic clouds\nincreases the risk of icing\n. In stable atmospheric conditions, the freezing level is positioned lower, and the severity of icing is heightened both upwind and downwind of the mountainous range.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nRelative Humidity (RH)\nThe ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage.\nDepends on moisture content and the temperature of the air.\nRH = (HMR/SMR) x 100\nRH 100% = Saturation\nAs we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature.\nIn simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated.\nFrom the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa.\nRelative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too.\nAs air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases.\nOn the other hand, since colder air doesn\u2019t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.\nNow, with regards to this question, if the parcel of air is forced to descend it will become compressed and hence heat up, by the adiabatic process =>\nSince its temperature increases, provided that the amount of water vapour remains the same - Relative humidity decreases.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states \u2013 initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage.\nCUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE\nLifting action initiates the vertical movement of air\nBecause of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.\nThe cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.\n=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.\nMATURE STAGE\nAs the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.\nThe down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.\nWithin the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)\nAs the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.\nIt can last up to 30 min\n=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).\nDISSIPATING STAGE\nAs the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell \u2013 taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.\n=> Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

        "explanation": "FEW CONSIDERATIONS:\nFirstly, it is important to point out that this is a Contour chart and pressure information is not provided - Pressure is constant everywhere\n=> this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level, in ISA conditions, corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations).\nIsohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed) ,then we can assume a low pressure.\nHaving that established,\u00a0it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts.\nThe closer the contours the stronger the wind.\nCirculation of air around a High and Low Pressure system:\nIn the Northern Hemisphere:\n-\u00a0The\u00a0air\u00a0moves anticlockwise\u00a0around a low pressure\u00a0centr\ne; and\n- Clockwise\u00a0around a high pressure\u00a0centre.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere:\n-\u00a0The\u00a0air\u00a0moves clockwise\u00a0around a low pressure\u00a0centre; and\n- Anticlockwise\u00a0around a high pressure\u00a0centre.\nWith regards to this question\n,\nWe can see that this question depicts a situation in the Northern Hemisphere, in Madrid.\nNow,\u00a0notice the wind arrow on the upper side of \"B\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from a\u00a0Easterly direction, therefore indicating an anticlockwise direction =>\nwhich means that both are low pressure areas.\nThe tighter packed Isohypses show lower elevations\n,\nwider spaced isohypses show higher elevations\n=> by looking at the isohypses, we can see that the\u00a0contours at \"A\" are closer than at \"B\", therefore\ntrue altitude is higher over \"B\" than \"A\"\n.\nFurthermore, as we have discussed, the contour lines are closer together at \"A\" than at \"B\",\u00a0so the wind is stronger at \"A\" than at \"B\".",

Can be defined as cold air replacing warm air.\nThe denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise.\nThe slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80.\nCold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts.\nThe front moves at right angles to itself at a\nspeed equal to the geostrophic interval (full)\nmeasured along the front.\nPrecipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM \u2013 mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it.\nA winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation.\nNote: The warm front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to\n2/3\nof the geostrophic interval measured along the front.",

When stratus is at its thinnest, the sun can be clearly seen through the stratus layer. Sometimes Stratus appears in the form of ragged patches.\nStratus clouds often dissipate during daytime by direct heating of the cloud layer by solar absorption and subsequent reduction in the relative humidity.",

Of course, it would be a little misleading to say that the aircraft is flying from B to A in an exam question, as many people would expect it to go from A to B and perhaps get the question wrong. This is why we are asking for\nfurther exam feedback to check what they ask\n, thank you!\nWe cannot assume the examiner will be nice, and unfortunately we must assume that there will be extra confusion caused where possible.\nLearning Objective 050.02.02.01.05: Indicate how the geostrophic wind flows in relation to the isobars/isohypses in the northern and in the southern hemisphere.\nIn the northern hemisphere, as this chart is, wind flows along the isobars, anti-clockwise around low pressure zones and clockwise around highs. That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. As we fly through the cold front about halfway through the route, this is a change in direction in the clockwise sense (known as \"\nveering\n\"), from approximately 230\u00b0 (SW) to approximately 280\u00b0(NW).\nThe isobars are also\ncloser together before we reach the cold front\n, meaning that the\nwind speed is higher\nin this region (the warm sector), and therefore\nthe wind speed decreases\nafter passing through the cold front.\nThe cold front is moving from West to East in the diagram, as is expected with a front in this region (and shown by the direction of the \"spikes\" on the front). This means that we are travelling directly opposite to it, starting in the warm sector ahead of the front, and passing through into the cold sector behind it.",

The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.\nThus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (+15) \u00d7 (15 000/1 000) =\n900 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n14 100 ft\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDefinitions\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "explanation": "In this location, at this time of year, the days can get quite hot, due to the proximity to the equator, and the general climate. The coolest time of the day is just after sunrise, and the ground and air heat up graddually until early afternoon, when the temperature begins to drop again. This means that between 08:30 and 11:00 local time, the temperature will have risen quite a bit.\nA rise in air temperature causes a reduction in air density\n, due to the increased collisions between particles, keeping them further apart.\nReduced air density leads to a reduction in the amount of air particles flowing over an aircraft's wings, which leads to a reduction in ift. This means that an aircraft must fly faster to gain the same amount of airflow, to get the same amount of lift. this lengthens take-off distances as the aircraft has to reach a higher speed.\nThe engines are even more affected by temperature rises and density reduction. both\npiston and gas turbine engines produce higher power when the air is colder (and therefore denser)\n, as there is more oxygen to burn alongside the fuel.\nGas turbine engines also become TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature) limited when temperatures get above a certain amount, and this leads to the engine having to reduce their thrust output to stop the turbine melting. Propellers are also affected in the same way as wings, by having reduced air, they produce less power.\nTherefore, no matter what type of aircraft is being referenced,\nthe power/thrust output will be reduced by the higher heat in the middle of the day\n, and therefore\nthe take-off climb performance will be degraded.",

Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle.\nThe cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes.\n=> This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts.\nMATURE STAGE\nAs the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage.\nThe down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions.\nWithin the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud)\nAs the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud.\nIt can last up to 30 min\n=> Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface).\nDISSIPATING STAGE\nAs the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell \u2013 taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape.\n=> Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey.

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water.\nIce crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds\n. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface.\nThus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow.\nWhether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

That is where the warm sector air above the frontal surface precipitates raindrops that are warmer than 0\u00b0C, into an area that is colder than 0\u00b0C. If an aircraft is within that cold sector, then the airframe will be below freezing temperature, and the droplets will be around 0\u00b0C, which will then freeze upon hitting the airframe, causing one of the most dangerous types of ice accumulation, rain-ice.\nRain-ice builds up incredibly quickly on all parts of the upper surface of the wing, not just the leading edge, meaning that\nstandard anti-ice and de-icing systems are only partially effective, and often completely overpowered by the ice accretion.\nAs warm fronts are very shallow, rain ice triangles are very wide but not usually very tall, in this case only 1000 ft.\nThis means that the best way to avoid them is to fly above or beneath the region in which they can occur.\nAlso, it is best to fly\nperpendicular to the front\n(therefore\nparallel to its direction of movement\n), so the rain-ice triangle danger can be passed through as quickly as possible, rather than staying near it for unnecessarily long. Unfortunately,\nthis is not possible as there will most likely be clouds in the warm sector at the level that is being flown\n(the pilot is VMC only), and\nthe pilot has to traverse the warm sector\nanyway within the cold sector to reach their destination.\nIn the case of this pilot who is licensed for VMC flight only, they cannot climb into the NS clouds above, and should instead\nremain under 1000 ft (the freezing level in the cold sector)\nto remain out of the rain-ice triangle. It is useful to note that there is a chance of ice pellets at this altitude, as the raindrops may have frozen on their descent. This is still far better than being inside the region of freezing rain.",

This rain then can instantly freeze onto the airframe, causing a fast build up of ice onto the aircraft surfaces. The annex above shows the location of the rain ice triangle, which is the region of danger for this phenomenon.\nThe rain ice triangle is relatively easy to work out from the question image, as the 0\u00baC isotherms are depicted on the chart, 3500 ft in the warm sector and at the surface in the cold sector near the flight path, meaning that the aircraft will be flying in the rain ice triangle at any level below 3500 ft, which is very likely for this flight.\nThe other options are either not applicable to this warm front area, or much less of a hazard than FZRA.",

        "explanation": "DATA:\nTrue altitude\n= True altitude which is obtained by adding the reading of the radio altimeter (1860 ft) and the ground elevation (3090 ft) \u2013 which gives us a true altitude of\n4950 ft\n(read when QNH set)\nIndicated altitude\n=\n4500 ft\n(1013 hPa set in the altimeter)\nTemperature\n= +6\u00baC \u2013 which corresponds to ISA\nFIRST METHOD\n: The difference in pressure will correspond to the difference between 4950 ft (TA) and 4500 ft (IA) = 450 ft converted to hPa. We know that close to the surface 1 hPa = 27 ft. Therefore:\n450 ft / 27 ft = 17 hPa approx.\nNow,\nWhen changing an altimeter setting to a lower value - Altimeter reading decreases. (ie. 1013 hPa to 999 hPa)\nWhen changing and altimeter setting to a higher value \u2013 Altimeter reading increases (ie. 1013 hPa to 1030 hPa)\nIn this case\n,\nwe want to increase the altimeter reading by 450 ft (from 4500 ft to 4950 ft). Therefore, we need to add 17 hPa to 1013 hPa for our altimeter to read true altitude of 4950 ft. QNH = 1013 + 17 =\n1030 hPa.\nSECOND METHOD:\nto simplify your calculations we suggest using the following formula:\nTA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) + (4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev)\nWhere TA = True Altitude and IA = Indicated Altitude.\n\u201c(4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev)\u201d can be disregarded in this case because temperature = ISA.\nTA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting)\n4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 (QNH \u2013 1013)\n4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 QNH \u2013 27351\nQNH = 1030 hPa approx.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with\ndeep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible\n.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nLearning Objective 050.08.03.04.03: Identify cold-air drops on weather charts.\nNote: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are\n\"cold pools\"\n, but the new syllabus refers to them as\n\"cold-air drops\"\n.

As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night.\nA Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion.\nThe following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet:\nThere should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop\n. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion.\nThe structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase.\nIf the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet",

        "correct_answer": "Approximately 1 420 ft",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 977 hPa = 36 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 36 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =\n1 080 ft\n. This value needs to be\nsubtracted\nfrom the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude\n= 5 000 ft - 1 080 ft =\n3 920\nft.\nTo determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude 1 600 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad+11.8 \u00baC. The actual outside air temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-10 \u00baC, which means we have an ISA deviation of\nISA approx. -22\u00baC.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22\u00baC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 920 ft - 1 600 ft =\n2 320 ft\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-22) \u00d7 (2 320/1000) = -\n204 ft\n.\nThe temperature correction is\nsubtracted\nfrom the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 920 ft - 204 ft =\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad3 716 ft\n.\nMeaning that our clearance from the obstacle is 3 716 - 2 320 =\n1 396 ft \u21d2\nclosest answer 1 420 ft\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account.

        "explanation": "Ice crystal icing\n(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing\u00a0icing\u00a0inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small\u00a0ice crystals.\u00a0At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition\u00a0(\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n).\u00a0Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions.\u00a0Research has shown\u00a0that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity)\u00a0can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind\nfrom the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.\nNormal thunderstorm avoidance procedures may help pilots avoid regions of high ice crystal content. These avoidance procedures include:\nAvoiding flying in visible moisture over storm cells. Visible moisture at high altitude must be considered a threat since intense storm cells may produce high concentrations of ice crystals at cruise altitude.\nFlying upwind of storms when possible.\nUsing the radar antenna tilt function to scan the reflectivity of storms ahead. Assess the height of the storms. Recognize that heavy rain below the freezing level typically indicates high concentrations of ice crystals above.\nAvoiding storm reflectivity by 20 nautical miles has been commonly used as a recommended distance from convection. This may not be sufficient for avoidance of high concentrations of ice crystals, as they are not visible on airborne radar.",

The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force. The latter is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars towards the lower pressure. This wind is called surface wind.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle - towards the LOW - and, therefore,\nbe deflected to the right\ncompared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (ie. Wind at 4000 ft) => hence, the increasing crosswind from the right during approach.\nAs we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nFOEHN EFFECT\nFoehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes\nof nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n=>\nOne such wind is the Chinook which blows on the eastern side of the Rocky mountains in Canada - usually blows during the winter months and produces a rapid and considerable rise in temperature.\nHow does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

Please report in the comments if you see this (or a similar style question in an exam, thank you.)\nTo start, we need to know the flight level (pressure altitude), and then the expected ISA temperature calculated to check the temperature in the option.\nCalculator Trick\nThis is more of a rule of thumb, you go down and across the calculator as shown in the annex above, and the numbers of the buttons are the hundreds of hectopascals, then you count up from 1 to 5, and those are the hundreds of flight levels.\nFor instance, 700 hPa is approximately FL100, 500 hPa is FL 180 (which is close to FL200, a discrepancy of this method), 300 hPa is approximately FL300, etc.\nNote: 200 hPa actually equates to FL390, and 100 hPa equates to FL510, to be a little more precise. The others are very close, remembering the 500hPa = FL180.\nWe can then use this method to calculate the flight level, and use the formula:\nISA temp. = 15 - 2 (pressure altitude in thousands of feet)\nAlso, remember that the ISA temperature reduces by 2\u00baC down to -56.6\u00baC, where it then becomes isothermal, so all altitudes above approx. 36 000 ft have an ISA temp of -56.5\u00baC, up to about 60 000 ft.\nUsing these methods,\nAt 700 hPa, the ISA temperature is -5\u00baC.\nAt 500 hPa, the ISA temperature is -21\u00baC.\nAt 200 hPa, the ISA temperature is -56.5\u00baC. (the ISA temperature does not drop below this value)\nAt 300 hPa, the ISA temperature is -45\u00baC.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nA cold-air drop is a mass of cold polar air which becomes separated from the other polar air by transiting towards the warmer air in the subtropical region.\nThis can take a few different forms, but the most usual form is that the air between 10-30,000ft is much colder in one patch (sometimes called a cold-air pool), than the sub-tropical air around it. This cold air means that the column of air in that region is much shorter than around it, as\npressure drops off more quickly with increasing height in a cold air mass\n.\nThe cold air becomes trapped\n, and usually forms a circle on a chart.\nThis does form a\nlow pressure zone high in the troposphere\n, which can be seen on medium and high level pressure charts. It also forms a region where there is a\nhuge amount of cold air sat on top of warm (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere\n. This means that there is a\nvery high environmental lapse rate\n, the warm air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink, and\nthis causes layers of massive instability.\nIt can often only be seen by\ncomparing the 10,000ft and 20/30,000ft charts\nto see the\nchange in pressure due to the thermal effect\n, but not by looking only at the surface pressure, where it may not be visible. The later stages of a cold-air drop usually ends up as a low pressure zone at the ground also, but this is not expected to be examined by EASA.\nThe large instability\ncan cause heavy convective activity\n, including cumulonimbus clouds if the low level air is moist enough, meaning that\nthey can be quite dangerous for aviation.",

        "explanation": "Airframe icing occurs because water freezes to a sub-zero degree airframe, and the subsequent ice build-up decreases lift, increases drag, and increases the aircraft weight, all of which are bad effects. This can occur because of supercooled water droplets in a cloud (droplets of water below 0\u00baC but which are still liquid) come into contact with the aircraft, or like in this question, where there is\nrain falling\n(perhaps from an inversion layer above) and the\noutside air temperature is negative\n, and therefore the\nairframe temperature is likely to be negative also\n, leading to\nrain ice.\nHigh level clouds such as cirrus do not cause airframe icing\n, as they are so cold, they are made up solely of ice crystals. The worst icing occurs inside cumulonimbus clouds, where very large super-cooled water droplets can exist.",

        "explanation": "Mountains deflect the direction of the air flow, which can cause pressure changes. This, in turn, may influence the pressure altimeter reading.\nWhen air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) that makes it flow with a stronger wind speed - as the cross section decreases,\nthe velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases\n. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle.\nA decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude. As altitude is calculated, when compared to the reference pressure setting (i.e QNH), when flying into lower pressure,\nthe true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude\n.",

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas.\nIn the northern hemisphere (NH), conditions on the right-hand side of storms are more severe than those on their left-hand sides. For that reason, in the NH, Right-hand semicircle (RHSC) is called the \u201cdangerous semicircle\u201d and Left-hand semicircle (LHSC) is called the \u201cnavigable semicircle\u201d.\nDangerous semicircle\n\u2014 It is the side of a tropical cyclone, w\nhich lies to the right of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern Hemisphere\n(to the left in the Southern Hemisphere)\n, where the storm has the strongest winds and heavy seas.\nNavigable semicircle \u2014 It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the left of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern hemisphere (to the right in the Southern Hemisphere), where the winds are weaker and better for the navigation purpose, although all parts of TRS are more or less dangerous to mariners.\nSUMMARY:\nThe fastest winds are found in the quadrant to the right of the storm track in the Northern Hemisphere and left of the track in the Southern Hemisphere.",

In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-15) \u00d7 (4 000/1000) = -240 ft.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad3 760\nf\nt\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at\n10 600 ft\n(8 600 ft + 2 000 ft).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -9\u00baC\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-9) \u00d7 (10 600/1000) =\n-382 ft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded\nto the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of \u00ad\u00ad\n10 98\n2\nft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa =\n18 hPa\n. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:\nPressure correction\n= 18 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =\n486 ft\n. This value needs to be\nadded\nto the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 10 982 ft + 486 ft =\n11 468 ft\n.\nAccording to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:\nFor Easterly magnetic tracks (000\u00b0 - 179\u00b0), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)\nFor Westerly magnetic tracks (180\u00b0 - 359\u00b0), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)\nThe aircraft flies an\nwestbound magnetic track VFR flight\n. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is:\nFL125\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR.\nSince colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes.\nBy the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +8\u00baC. The airfield elevation must be taken into consideration for the temperature correction: 2 600 ft - 600 ft = 2 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (8) \u00d7 (2 000/1000) = 64 ft.\nThe temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad2 664\nf\nt\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n).\nEngine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected\n.\nSeveral engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions\n. Research has shown that\nstrong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes\nwhere it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nThese areas are perfect places for ICI to occur,\nin and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes.\nTherefore, we can keep a good lookout for such clouds using our onboard weather radar, which readily picks up cumulonimbus clouds due to their large water content.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThis question calls them oceanic mesoscale convective systems, which simply means that the storms are full of moisture from the sea below, and are at least medium in size. Smaller convective systems would not be powerful enough to cause significant ice crystal icing. See the annex above for a visual representation of where HIWC (High Ice Water Content) can be found.\nThese very small ice crystals are\nnot found in cirrus clouds\n. The ice crystals which make up cirrus clouds are much larger, and actually less dangerous to fly through, especially as they can be easily seen.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nFOEHN EFFECT\nFoehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side.\n- How does it form?\nWhen air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst\non the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nWith regards to this question\n, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds.\nThe north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer => little or no precipitation, good visibility and clear air turbulence is expected.",

The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground.\n- Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,\nthe thinner the air and the less performance from your engines\n(and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreases aircrafts performance leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air -\nwhich reduces the aircraft's rate of climb.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTrue altitude calculation from a Flight Level:\nIn this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude.\nThe first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 983 = 30 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 30 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad900 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:\nIndicated altitude\n= 10 000 ft - 900 ft =\n9 100 ft\n.\nNext, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15\u00baC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 \u00d7 (-15) \u00d7 (9 100/1000) = -546 ft.\nThe temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n8 554 ft\n.\nClosest option: 8640 ft\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate\n(if not provided by the question)\n.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account.

The temperature could be more or less than +15\u00baC and the pressure could be more or less than 1013.2hPa; it doesn't have to be ISA conditions. Let's now see why:\nQFE is the pressure value at the airfield;\nQNH is a QFE value which has been brought to MSL using ISA conditions;\nIf you were to use actual conditions, QFF would be obtained instead.\nImagine that you are in an airfield at MSL, you measure QFE and obtain i.e. 1020 hPa\nNow, reduce it to MSL with standard conditions to obtain QNH. You are already at MSL, the value is the same.\nReduce it to MSL with real conditions to obtain QFF => again, you are already at MSL, the value will not change.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals,\nmostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud\n- the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.\nThese areas are perfect places for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of\nhuge convective clouds\nwith plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes. Therefore, we can keep a good lookout for such clouds using our\nonboard weather radar\n,\nwhich readily picks up cumulonimbus clouds\ndue to their large water content.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart\nand higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

        "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.01.06.03.06: Determine the true altitude/height for a given altitude/height and a given ISA temperature deviation.\nThere are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots:\nTrue Altitude - The actual altitude above msl (mean sea level).\nIndicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure.\nPressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels.\nIt also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True.\nIn any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question they have given us a\nPressure Altitude of 3 300 ft\n, and also an\nIndicated\nHeight\nof 3300 ft\n. Not only does that tell us that the\nQNH is the same as standard pressure setting (1013 hPa)\n, but it also tells us that our\nQFE is also the same pressure, and therefore our airport is at sea level\n. This has the very nice effect of making\nheight and altitude interchangeable.\nThis simplifies the question into a temperature correction only, from Indicated Altitude to True Altitude.\nTEMPERATURE CORRECTION\nA good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA.\n==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude.\n==>\nWhen OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.\nAs this scenario has an OAT of 15\u00baC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. (There are a couple of different ways to calculate this, but they all use the same formula with shifted decimal places).\nTemperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude\n*\n[in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA)\nSo for this calculation,\nTemp. Correction = 4 x 3.3 x 15 =\n198 ft\nTrue Altitude is less than Indicated Altitude, so\nTrue Altitude (and also True Height) = 3 300 - 198 =\n3 102 ft\n*\nIndicated Altitude between the aircraft and the point at which the pressure is measured, but in this scenario, that is sea level, so Indicated Altitude works. For example, if the pressure had been measured at 1 000ft, then the number 2.3 (thousands of feet) would be used instead of 3.3.",

When the air gets pushed up or mixed up enough to reach its dewpoint, the cloud base forms, and if the air is raised above this, then the cloud continues upwards as high as the air is pushed/mixed.\nAn inversion, however, is much too stable, and any air moving into the inversion will either fall back out of the layer, as the layer is a lot warmer than the air below (preventing mixing of the air), or just warm up above the dewpoint and stop forming cloud.

You can now draw an arrow representing the wind direction\n(purple arrow on the figure).\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, when flying towards a HIGH (LOW behind), you will be experiencing a crosswind from the right.\nKeep in mind the general wind circulation:\nNorthern Hemisphere; around a LOW it is anti-clockwise and around a HIGH it is clockwise.\nSouthern Hemisphere; around a LOW it is clockwise and around a HIGH it is anti-clockwise.",

        "explanation": "050.05.02.01.08: Explain the relationship between moisture content and visibility during different types of winter precipitation (e.g. large vs small snowflakes).\nMoisture content and type of precipitation are the main factors of visibility during precipitation. For instance, rain has relatively good visibility, as the light is scattered a little through each raindrop, but they are relatively see through still. More importantly,\nrain is a very dense form of precipitation\n, as so there are less raindrops than for a snow shower of the same moisture content\n.\nSnow, therefore, has quite poor visibility\n, depending on the intensity of course. A light snow shower would still have better visibility than a heavy tropical rain shower.\nFor this question, we should consider each option:\nA) \"Visibility in precipitation with large snow flakes is worse than in rain.\"\nThis is absolutely correct\n, snow flakes give worse visibility than rain. Large snowflakes are worse still, as they block more light.\nB) \"Visibility in a shower with blowing snow is better than in heavy rain.\"\nBlowing snow is where the wind picks up the snow from the ground and the snow which falls during a snow shower, creating very low visibility indeed, as low as 1 metre visibility. Heavy rain is not as bad as this, so this is incorrect.\nC) \"Visibility in heavy snow is better than in drizzle with small water droplets.\"\nI think it is quite obvious that visibility is very bad in heavy snow, and not nearly as bad in drizzle, so this is incorrect.\nD) \"Regardless of the moisture content, the visibility in rain is worse than in snow.\"\nAs discussed above, it is more difficult to see through snow, which is a much less dense form of precipitation, so takes up more space, and is also more opaque than rain. This is therefore incorrect.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\n050.09.01.04.05: Explain how a pilot may possibly avoid areas with a high concentration of ice crystals.\nIce crystal icing\n(ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in\nhigh altitude\ndue to high concentration of very small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (\noften referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology\n).\nEngine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected\n.\nSeveral engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions\n. Research has shown that\nstrong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes\nwhere it can freeze into very small ice crystal.\nThe best way to avoid ICI is laterally, by travelling more than the standard 20 nm away from the regions of high convective activity, and if possible, reducing the risk even further by travelling upwind of the area, so that the wind does not blow ice crystals into the path of the aircraft.\nThis question asks further about whether to be above and below the tropopause to avoid the majority of the ice crystals. This is a little more difficult, as ice crystal icing events have occurred both above and below the tropopause in the past. It does look like most of the HIWC (High Ice Water Content - responsible for ICI) exists below the tropopause for the majority of storms, and those CBs that break through the tropopause do not seem to spread out the ice crystals very far from the cloud. See the annex for a visual representation of this.\nFor this reason,\nan aircraft should remain above the tropopause to best avoid Ice Crystal Icing\n.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -15\u00baC.\nHowever, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing",

Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars.\nIce crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off\n. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing \u201crain\u201d as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen.\nThe main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be\ndownwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud\n- the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.\nIn the case of this question\n,\nthe first part of the route including the initial climb is completely clear of large convective active such as CBs.\nHowever, for the last hundreds of NM or so, the aircraft is cruising at FL450 completely within a region of ISOL EMBD CBs with tops of FL480.\nThis area would be a perfect place for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture\ncarried up to the high altitudes.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nTROPICAL REVOLVING STORMS (TRS). Are thermal depressions that develop over warm tropical oceans (wind speeds in excess of 33 kts). When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kts, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas.\nTropical revolving storms only form in certain conditions:\nMust be within 5 and 25 latitude\n(Below 5\u00ba, Coriolis force is too small, above 25\u00ba latitude the sea is usually too cold)\nOcean temperatures must be greater than 26.5\u00baC. The higher the ocean temperature the greater the pressure drop within the core => This is the reason why we do not usually have TRS forming in the southern Atlantic because the sea surface temperatures are too low.\nSufficiently unstable atmosphere at low level (so convective clouds penetrate the Trade wind inversion).\nDirection of Movement\nAfter a Tropical Revolving Storm forms,\nthey usually travel Westwards\n(from east to west), in the Northern Hemisphere. In the mature stage,\nthey begin to turn Northwards\n(in the Northern Hemisphere). The storm, then,\nmay re-curve at around 20\u00b0N or S\n=> where it might then track\nNorth-Eastwards\n(It must be noted though\nthat recurvature may not take place\n).",

Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated.\nFreezing fog occurs when fog forms in temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain as liquid. They become supercooled water droplets remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature.\nThis occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals is formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nMountain Waves =\noscillations to the lee side (downwind) of high ground resulting from the disturbance in the horizontal air flow caused by the high ground.\nMountain waves are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere.\nMountain waves may also be referred to as standing waves or lee waves. These are likely to form when the following\natmospheric conditions are present\n:\nWind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band.\nWind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 20 knots, increasing with height.\nA marked layer of stability around the altitude of the summits, e.g. an isothermal layer or inversion, with less stable air above and below\nIf the wave amplitude is large enough, then the waves become unstable and break, similar to the breaking waves seen in the surf. Within these 'breaking waves', the atmospheric flow becomes turbulent. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 4,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors\nto form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.\nProvided there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds are formed with mountain waves and these provide useful warning of the presence of such waves. The clouds are:\nLenticular, or lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind. They may be found up to, and possibly above, the tropopause.\nRotor, or roll-clouds occur under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind and will be level or slightly above the ridge crest.\nCap clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes.\nMountain Waves are associated with severe turbulence, strong vertical currents, and icing.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart\nand higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

        "correct_answer": "There is no cross wind",
        "explanation": "An air parcel initially at rest will move from high pressure to low pressure because of the pressure gradient force. However, as that air parcel begins to move, it is deflected by the Coriolis force to the right in the northern hemisphere (to the left on the southern hemisphere). As the wind gains speed, the deflection increases until the Coriolis force equals the pressure gradient force. At this point, the wind will be blowing parallel to the isobars. When this happens, the wind is referred to as\ngeostrophic\n. The geostrophic wind is directed parallel to isobars and the strength is directly proportional to the spacing of the isobars. It is found at altitudes of around 2 000 feet and above. The true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground. Thus, the actual wind would equal the geostrophic wind only if there were no friction and the isobars were perfectly straight.\nIn case of this specific question:\nTrue altitude remains constant, so we will be flying at at constant pressure which will be parallel to isobars. Geostrophic wind is parallel to isobars so we will not have any crosswind. That is why this statement is correct.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLIGHTNING is a huge electrical discharge that flows between clouds, from a cloud to air, or from a cloud to the ground. It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10\u00b0C and -10\u00b0C.\nLightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail.\nThis happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage\n(a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.\nThe main effects of a lightning strike are:\nTemporary blindness of the pilots\nMinor airframe damage\nMagnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked\nDisruption to electrical equipment",

For this reason, they are known as Blocking Highs or BLOCKING ANTICYCLONES.\nThe blocking anticyclone starts as a ridge of high pressure extending from a high pressure source region such as the sub-tropical Azores High (annex above) which breaks off and\nestablishes itself as a separate anticyclone\n.

        "explanation": "This question gives us a planned Flight Level of 290 (pressure altitude 29,000ft) and some meteorological conditions, which we must use to calculate our true altitude, and then compare to the local highest terrain to find our terrain clearance at this altitude.\nTo start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn\npressure altitude\ninto\nindicated altitude.\nThe QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 =\n31 hPa\nless\nthan standard pressure. Because we are in\nlow pressure\n, our indicated altitude is\nlower\nthan our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 =\n930 ft\nlower than the pressure altitude.\nIndicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 =\n28,070 ft\nTo make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate.\nISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43\u2070C, but our OAT is 17\u2070C colder than this at -60\u2070C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17\u2070C.\nAs our\ntemperature is lower than ISA\n, our true altitude will be even\nlower\nthan our indicated altitude.\nTemperature correction = 4 x ISA Deviation x Height above QNH station (in thousands of feet).\nIn this case, the QNH station is near sea level, so our temperature correction is 4 x -17 x 28.070 = (-)\n1909 ft\nTherefore, true altitude = 28,070 - 1,909 =\n26,161 ft\nThis makes our terrain clearance 26,161 - 25,460 =\n701 ft, closest answer\n680 ft\nNote: Correct option is updated according to the latest feedback. The correct answers were 590 ft and 690 ft before. We are not sure why the authorities are using 590 ft, as it is further away from the correct answer than the original feedback of 680 ft, but they do sometimes work in mysterious ways.",

They always form at least 5\u00ba North or South of the Equator, and\nturn away from the Equator\ninitially.\nTheir tracks are always very difficult to forecast.\nAs seen in the annex above, Cyclones in the South Indian Ocean (that is what Tropical Revolving Storms are called in that region)\nstart Westwards/South-Westwards and turn gradually more to the South\n.

Where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude (in the troposphere), then we have what is called an inversion.\nWe can think of an inversion as a \"Tupperware lid\" for the atmosphere - it limits the upward movement of air from lower parts of the atmosphere (inhbits vertical mixing). Consequently, air pollutants, smoke, and dust aren't able to be dispersed throughout the atmosphere. This accumulation of particulates can cause reduced visibility below the inversion.\nWith regards to this question\n, as we have discussed, as we descend through an inversion, temperature decreases with a decrease in height =>\nThrust and lift will increase as the aircraft descends into colder and denser air.\nAir pollutants, smoke, and dust will not disperse vertically, instead they are trapped below the inversion -\nresulting in a deteriorated visibility.",

Blowing snow can be falling snow or snow that already accumulated but is picked up and blown about by strong winds. It is one of the classic requirements for a blizzard. As an obstruction to vision, it is encoded as\nBLSN\nas an obstruction to vision in a\nMETAR\nreport.\nDrifting snow\nis only raised from the ground surface by the wind to a height of less than 2 m (6 ft) creeping, rolling and bouncing above the surface. While drifting snow is not regarded as a major vision hazard for aviation it is a major hazard for surface transportation (including taxying small aircraft). The visibility can be as low as 1m in drifting snow.\nSnow Grains\nare small grains of ice. They do not produce much accumulation and are the solid equivalent to drizzle.\nSnow Pellets\nare ice crystals that grow by supercooled water accreting onto them as they fall. They look like tiny hailstones, but are a bright white colour, and often have formed so quickly that they break as soon as they hit the ground. They can be up to 5mm in diameter, and can also be formed when snow and sleet melt, and then re-freeze.",

        "explanation": "A\nflat pressure distribution\nimplies\nwidely spaced isobars\nthat indicate the same atmospheric pressure over relatively large areas.\nWidely spaced isobars\nalso imply a\nsmall pressure gradient force\nand since the pressure gradient force is small, we can expect\nlight\nor\ncalm wind\n.\nIn this context\nthe development of\nlocal wind systems\nis likely to occur:\n> Land\nand\nSea Breezes\n>\nKatabatic\nand\nAnabatic winds\nSea breezes\nOn a\nsunny\nday, particularly in an\nanticyclone\nwith a\nlight PGF\n, the land will heat quickly. The air in contact will be warmed and will rise and expand so that pressure at about 1000 ft will be higher than pressure at the same level over the sea. This will cause a drift of air from over the land to over the sea at about 1000 ft. The drift of air will cause the surface pressure over the land to fall, and the surface pressure over the sea to rise. As a result there will be a flow of air\nfrom\nsea\nto\nland\n.\nOn average, sea breezes extend 8 to 14 NM either side of the coast and the speed is about\n10 kt\n. In the tropics speed is 15 kt or more and the inland extent is greater. The direction of the sea breeze is more or less at right angles to the coast, but after some time it will veer under the influence of the Coriolis Force.\nLand breezes\nFrom mid-afternoon the land is starting to cool and this process will accelerate after sunset. Overnight the situation will reverse and pressure will now be higher on land than over the sea as the temperature reduces. This will give rise to a wind now blowing\nfrom\nland\nto\nsea\n. The land breeze can be expected within about 5 NM of the coastline and with a maximum speed of about\n5 kt\n.\nKatabatic wind\nA\nkatabatic wind\nor\nmountain wind\nis caused by a flow of\ncold\nair\ndown a hill or mountain side\nat\nnight\n.\nIf the side of the mountain is\ncooled\n, the air in contact is also cooled: it will thus be\ndenser\nand\nheavier\nthan the surrounding air and it will therefore flow down the mountain side.\nThe katabatic effect is most marked if the mountain side is\nsnow\ncovered, if the\nsky\nis\nclear\nto assist radiation and if the\nPG\nis\nslack\n. Speeds average\n10 kt\nand the flow of cold air into the valley helps\nfrost\nand\nfog\nto form. Another effect is that with the sinking of cold air down the slope, the air at higher levels will be warmer and an\ninversion\nresults.\nAnabatic wind\nAn\nanabatic wind\nor\nvalley wind\nis a light wind of around\n5 kt\nwhich blows\nup a hill or mountain\nby\nday\n.\nOn a\nwarm sunny\nday, the slope of a hill will become\nheated\nby insolation, particularly if it is a south facing slope.\nThe air in contact with the ground will be heated by\nconduction\nand will rise up the hill. Free\ncold air\nwill replace the lifted air and so a\nlight wind\nwill blow up\nthe hillside.",

This gives rise to\nCumulus and Cumulonimbus\n, heavy showers (sometimes hail and thunderstorms). Visibility is good (except in showers). At night inland the cloud dissipates, the clearing skies causing a low level inversion with stable air below - ideal conditions for radiation fog.\nIf an air mass flows from cold to warmer regions, it will be heated from underneath, which makes it unstable\n. Therefore, polar and arctic air masses become unstable, whereas tropical air masses become more stable when travelling to colder areas.\nFurther info on Air Masses:\nAir masses are classified according to moisture content, source or type and temperature using a 3-letter system:\nFirst letter - moisture content:\nContinental (c)\nMaritime (m)\nSecond letter - source region or type (latitude/temperature):\nEquatorial.

There are currently two theories governing the formation of these precipitation drops:\nBERGERON THEORY.\nIt involves supercooled water droplets and explains how ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid cloud droplets within a mixed cloud\n.  There are more water molecules surrounding the water droplets than there are surrounding the ice crystals.  This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature.  Some of the water droplets will turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the temperature.\nUnlike the Bergeron Process, where precipitation forms under supercooled conditions, the\nCOALESCENCE PROCESS\ntypically occurs within relatively warm clouds with tops warmer than -15\u00baC. As you can tell by the name of this process, the collision of falling and rising droplets is what allows them to grow large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nLearning Objective 050.02.02.01.07: Explain the gradient wind effect and indicate how the gradient wind differs from the geostrophic wind in cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation.\nThis question is made up of two parts, first we need to know which latitude the wind will be weakest at, and secondly we need to know whether high or low pressure zones (anti-cyclones or cyclones) have the lowest gradient wind speed.\nTo start, we have to understand how the (geostrophic) wind works.\n1. Initially, wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF),\nfrom high to low pressure\n.\n2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be\ndeflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere\n, and\nto the left in the Southern Hemisphere\n. If the Coriolis Force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90\u00ba angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF.\n3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars \u2013 PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces).\nThe Coriolis Force is directly proportional to the speed of the wind\n, so\nwhen we have a high PGF, we need a high CF to oppose it, and the wind flows\nfaster.\nThe Coriolis Force also gets stronger away from the equator\n, due to the changing distance from the Earth's rotational axis (barely any change around the equator, lots of change up at the poles). This means that, near the equator, air has to get a lot faster to work up enough Coriolis Force to oppose the PGF, meaning higher wind speeds.\nTherefore, the further away from the equator (the higher the latitude), the slower the wind speeds\n(for the same PGF, which is the isobar spacing)\nNext, we must understand what the gradient wind is, and when it is strongest/weakest.\nPreviously, we have spoken about the geostrophic wind, which is the wind that flows along straight isobars. That is a rarity though, and more often, isobars are curved, meaning that the wind is turning. This introduces imbalanced forces, which cause this turning of the wind.\nNote: There are a couple of different ways to reason and understand gradient winds, centrifugal force and centripetal force. Centrifugal force is not actually a force at all, it is the effect of inertia in a turn. Nonetheless, you may have learnt either of these two ways. We believe centripetal force is slightly easier to explain in text format, so we will do that.\nIf you wish to take the easy road here, remember that,\nfor the same isobar spacing (same PGF), gradient wind speed is\nLOW around a LOW,\nand\nHIGH around a HIGH\n.\nThis means the\nwind is slower around a low pressure zone (cyclone)\nand\nfaster around a high pressure zone (anticyclone)\n. This should be sufficient for the vast majority of questions.\nIf you would like to gain a slightly higher level of understanding, continue reading.\nThe change of direction of the wind happens because of imbalanced forces, and the two main forces on the wind are Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and Coriolis Force. If either becomes larger than the other, then the wind will bend in that direction. This means that in a high pressure zone, for instance,\nthe PGF outwards is not as strong as the Coriolis Force inwards, as the wind is bending in the direction of the Coriolis Force\n. To do this,\nthe wind has to go faster than usual\n(usual being the geostrophic, straight line wind), to build up a higher Coriolis Force.\nThe opposite is happening around the low pressure zone.\nThe PGF is stronger than the Coriolis Force\n, meaning that the resultant, or \"residual\", force is going inwards towards the low. This means that the Coriolis Force is weaker than usual, and therefore\nthe wind speed is less than the geostrophic wind.\nThis \"residual force\" is what we call centripetal force\n, and is the force which causes rotation to occur. It is a force towards the centre of rotation, and without it, objects will just continue in the same direction. We need centripetal force to allow wind to bend around low and high pressure zones, and it comes from imbalanced PGF and Coriolis Force, which causes the\nlow around a low\nand\nhigh around a high\nbehaviour we have discussed.\nRemember, the PGF stays the same, but the Coriolis Force changes due to the wind speed.\nIn conclusion then, to get the weakest wind speeds with the same isobar spacing, we need\na high latitude and a low pressure zone\n, so\n50\u00baN and a cyclonic system\n.",

It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog \u2013 it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.\nFurthermore, as discussed above, Airborne Weather radar detects large droplet precipitation and hail (present in CBs), it does not detect stratus/stratocumulus or very small water droplets => making it relatively easy to identify embedded cumulonimbus.\nAccording to ICAO AC 120-88A Appendix 1:\nAVOID any convective activity (CBs) en route by at least 20 nautical miles.",

        "explanation": "Immediately we can see that the most likely location for these types of highly convective weather is going to be on the steeper cold front (instead of a warm front), the more aggressive of the two simple weather fronts. Yes, a warm occlusion will include a bit of cold front at altitude, but as it is a warm occlusion, the majority of it acts as a warm front.\nThis leaves us with a fast-moving cold front and a slow-moving cold front. This is slightly counterintuitive, as one might think that a fast moving cold front is likely to be more \"aggressive\" than a slow-moving one, but it is actually the opposite.\nMeteorologists call\nslow-moving cold fronts \"active cold fronts\"\n. This is because their slower movement means that the associated uplift is more gradual, and with a slightly shallower slope, gives rise to\na much wider band of convective clouds, thunderstorms, precipitation and turbulence\n, going up the side of the front, which spreads the weather over a long distance.\nfast-moving cold fronts are referred to as \"inactive cold fronts\". This is a bit of a misnomer, as they still cause plenty of aggressive uplift, which leads to significant bands of thunderstorms and heavy convection in unstable atmospheric conditions, but\nthe band of thunderstorms is much thinner, and remains ahead of the front\n(not up the sloped side of the front like slow-moving cold fronts).\nThis is why the answer is that\nthunderstorms, CBs and convective clouds are more likely to be encountered at and around a\nslow-moving cold front.",

Please let us know if you get this in the exam, and send us any feedback you can remember, thank you!\nThe aircraft has been cruising above the transition layer, in reference to a flight level, so has had standard pressure setting (1013.2 hPa) set. This means that\nthe altimeter is indicating the pressure altitude of the aircraft\n. If the pilot forgets to change the subscale to the QNH of 1006 hPa, the aircraft will not indicate the correct altitude when flying below the transition layer, and will therefore be wrong when at the platform altitude of 5000 ft.\nConverting from pressure altitude to indicated altitude (altitude with QNH set) will tell us how high the aircraft actually is when the pilot flies at 5000 ft (with 1013 hPa set), as there are no differences in temperature from ISA, therefore indicated altitude = true altitude.\nIndicated altitude is based on QNH, so\nwhenever QNH is high\n(higher than 1013),\nindicated altitude is high\n. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard.\n==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude.\n==>\nWhen QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude.\nIndicated altitude varies from pressure altitude by the amount of hPa difference multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which is 30 ft/hPa.\n1013 - 1006 =\n7 hPa\n7 x 30 =\n210 ft\nNo temperature correction, so the aircraft's true altitude is 5000 - 210 =\n4790 ft.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nStructural Icing\nIt builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems.\nThere are 2 general types of structural icing:\nRIME ICE\nNormally encountered in\nstratiform clouds\n. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0\u00baC to -30\u00baC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft\u2019s surface.\nIt has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing.\nCLEAR ICE\nCan develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft\u2019s surface).\nClear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds\n(dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0\u00baC to -10\u00baC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25\u00baC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40\u00baC.\nClear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.\nNote: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.\nIcing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE\nTYPE OF ICING\nRIME ICE\n(Small supercooled water droplets\nStratiform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -15\u00baC\n-15\u00baC TO -30\u00baC\nExpect moderate icing\nExpect light icing\nCLEAR ICE\n(Large supercooled water droplets\nCumuliform clouds)\n0\u00baC TO -10\u00baC\nMay be found in CB\u2019s at -25\u00baC\nExpect severe icing\n=> Regarding this question, \u201cdense layered\u201d cloud means stratiform cloud, therefore, we can assume\nRIME ICE\nmight occur.\nAt -25\u00baC, we can expect light icing.",

        "explanation": "In flight airframe icing occurs when an aircraft flies through icing conditions.\nIcing conditions are mostly present within clouds below freezing temperature (0\u00baC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a \"supercooled\" state, in that their temperature is less than 0\u00baC, but they are still liquid. We call them\nSupercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs).\nWhen an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze,\nadhering to the airframe in the process\n. This can form icing such as\nrime ice, clear ice, or mixed ice (a mixture of the two).\nThis can occur in precipitation also\n, particularly when the air temperature or airframe is below 0\u00baC, where rain, freezing rain, or wet snow can adhere to the airframe or engines.\nIn reality, the best option here is \"dry snow\",\nas dry snow is considered to be made up of\nsolid ice crystals only\n, not any water droplets that could freeze onto the wing. Therefore,\ndry snow is very unlikely to adhere to the wing, unlike the other options.\nEven \"snow and rain\" has a higher chance of causing airframe icing than dry snow, as the temperature will be very close to 0\u00baC in this instance, and the airframe or air temperature may be intermittently below 0\u00baC, causing ice accretion. The other two options are obviously very likely to cause problematic ice accretion.",

The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force. The latter is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars towards the lower pressure. This wind is called surface wind.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the\nleft\ncompared to the equivalent geostrophic wind. => Therefore,\nin the Northern Hemisphere, wind backs with decreasing altitude (meaning that winds will veer as we climb through the friction layer).\nOnce out of the friction layer, winds should stop veering and should start blowing parallel to isobars. However, the question states that a warm front is approaching and at the warm front, the wind sharply veers => which means that the winds above the friction layer will continue to veer.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture,\nproducing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon)\n.\nThe SW Monsoon affects all of India\n, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"\nshadowing\n\" effect occurs.\nThe stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words,\nRadar attenuation (shadowing) is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm.\nTip for avoiding shadows:\nTo accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns.\nIf you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it.\nIf you don\u2019t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it\u2019s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

        "explanation": "If flying around mountains, be extra cautious. The air being lifted up the mountain slopes by the wind (called orographic lifting) causes icing to be more intense than it is usual under identical conditions over low, flat terrain. It is known to produce moderate to severe icing conditions. Icing is greater over the ridges than over valleys and greater on the windward side than on the leeward side.\nThe lifting of the cold unstable by the mountains results in the formation of more-or-less continuous supercooled clouds. Also,\nthe orographically-induced updrafts permit the air to support larger cloud droplets than otherwise, so that the icing is more intense. Furthermore, dust from the mountain slopes induce ice accretion - due to the presence of freezing nucleus.\nFreezing nucleus, any particle that, when present in a mass of supercooled water, will induce growth of an ice crystal about itself; most ice crystals in the atmosphere are thought to form on freezing nuclei.",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes.\nIt is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at an altitude of 4 000 ft, unless local QNH is set. Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1013 hPa is set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 4 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same altitude as the remaining traffic.\nTo solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to the local QNH (\nthe aircraft\u2019s True Altitude\n).\nWe suggest that you use the following formula:\nTA = IA + 27 (Local QNH \u2013 Pressure setting)\nWhere; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate.\nTA = 4 000 ft + 27 (1030 hPa \u2013 1013 hPa)\nTA = 4 459 ft\nThe aircraft is 4 459 ft \u2013 4 000 ft =\n459 ft higher than remaining traffic.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used, which would give you a result of 510 ft.",

Mountain-wave turbulence in the presence of directional wind shear over the Rocky Mountains in Colorado is a common weather phenomenon observed.\nMOUNTAIN WAVES are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier. The most intense turbulence is usually located at low-levels, leeward of the mountains in or near the rotor cloud, if present.\nMountain waves coming off the Rocky Mountains can exist at altitudes higher than most jets can fly - Often extends from the surface to slightly above the tropopause.\nThey also can exist hundreds of miles on the downwind side of the mountains over featureless terrain (100 NM - 300 NM, sometimes up to 600 NM).",

        "correct_answer": "A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and cold front. At the surface, it resembles a warm front with embedded CBs. The precipitation falls ahead of the surface position of the front.",
        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nOCCLUDED FRONT.\nIf a\ncold front catches up to and overtakes a warm front\n, the frontal boundary created between the two air masses is called and occluded front.\nWhen the cold front catches up with the warm front, the warm sector is lifted.\nWARM OCCLUSION:\nthe air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air behind the cold front.\nThe cold air behind the cold front rises over colder air ahead of the warm front. The \"less cold\" air rises over the leading colder air. This forces the cold front aloft (It \"climbs up\" the back of the warm front).\nWarm, moist and unstable air is lifted. The warm front acts as normal, but\nthe extra cold front forces air upwards\n, causing\nembedded CBs\n(\nthey are embedded within the usual warm front clouds\n).\nCOLD OCCLUSION: the air behind the cold front is colder than the air ahead of the warm front.\nThe cold air behind the cold front undercuts the less cold air ahead of the warm front. Warm front aloft.\nWarm, moist and stable air is lifted.\nTo go through each option:\n\"In a warm occlusion, the warm, moist tropical maritime air overrides the cold polar maritime air ahead. Precipitation and radiation fog occur ahead of the surface position of the front.\"\nWhilst this is partially correct, it refers to a\nwarm front ONLY\n, and also says\nradiation fog, which is not correct\neven for a warm front itself.\n\"A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and cold front. At the surface, it resembles a warm front with embedded CBs. The precipitation falls ahead of the surface position of the front.\"\nCorrect\n. As can be seen in the explanation and figures above, a warm occlusion is both a warm and a cold front, with exactly these characteristics.\n\"A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and a cold front. At the surface, it resembles a cold front with embedded CBs and heavy rain, which are located close to just behind the surface position of the front.\"\nIncorrect. At the surface it resembles a warm front (the warm front is the one that reaches the ground), and the precipitation occurs in front of the where the front meets the ground.\n\"In a warm occlusion, the cool polar continental air mass undercuts the colder arctic maritime air mass. The rain band just ahead of the surface position of the front has embedded CBs, severe turbulence, and hail. A thick frontal fog follows the surface position of the front.\"\nIncorrect, there is no \"undercutting\" in a warm occlusion. All the air rises over the leading air, as the leading air is the coldest (and therefore most dense).",

If an air mass gets cooler and the relative humidity passes 100% (past the amount it can hold), the excess water will begin to condense as droplets (or depose into ice crystals directly if cold enough). This forms clouds, when the temperature drops below the dew point as air rises.\nAs the clouds are being forced to rise by the terrain (and we have not been told that precipitation has yet begun to fall), the airmass is cooling, and the colder air will not be able to hold as much moisture in vapour form, so\nmore and more of the stored vapour will condense into droplets or ice crystals\n(depending on the freezing level).\nAs this is\nunlikely to make the current droplets/crystals larger due to the rate of coalescence usually being lower than the rate of droplet formation\n, the only possible correct answer is that\nthe concentration of droplets/crystals in the cloud will increase.",

        "correct_answer": "Condensation.",
        "explanation": "The main two types of clouds are stratified/layered (stratiform) and convective (cumuliform). They both form due to the condensation of water in the air, due to there being more than 100% relative humidity. Air can only hold so much water in vapour form, so in excess of this amount, water condenses on nuclei (such as dust, salt or sand) in the atmosphere, creating clouds of water droplets.\nWhen water does condense from vapour into droplets, it\nreleases \"latent heat\"\n(as it has gone from a high energy state of matter to a lower energy state)\n.\nThis warms up the atmosphere. It is this warming that fuels the continued uplift of convective clouds and large convective storms, and storm systems.\nThis release of latent heat means that\nclouds are more often warmer than their surrounding air, and therefore will continue to rise\n. We call this atmospheric instability. It takes quite a high environmental lapse rate for dry air to be unstable (more than the DALR [3\u00baC/1000ft]), but when a cloud forms, and more water condenses as the cloud gets higher (in colder air),\nit becomes much easier for an air mass to be unstable\n. The ELR only needs to be more than the SALR (2\u00baC/1000ft), and the cloud will want to continue to rise, as it is constantly warmer than its surroundings.\nIt is\nthis condensation, and the heat it releases\n, that feeds the large updrafts in convective clouds, and creates the intense storms that can come from cumulonimbus clouds, and tropical revolving storms too.",

This means that attempting to climb above them is a dangerous gamble, with potential for severe clear air turbulence, certainly not worth it, especially in this case.

        "correct_answer": "FL70",
        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at\n6 430 ft\n(2 000 ft + 4 430 ft).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nTo compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2\u00baC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15\u00baC - (2 420/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of \u00ad\u00ad+10\u00baC. The actual temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad+9\u00baC, which is an ISA deviation of\nISA -1\u00baC\n.\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA -1\u00baC\n. The airfield elevation must be taken into account for temperature correction: 6 430 ft - 2 420 ft = 4 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (-1) \u00d7 (4 010/1000) =\n-16 ft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nadded\nto the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n6 446\nft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 994 hPa =\n19 hPa\n. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:\nPressure correction\n= 19 hPa x 27 ft/hPa =\n513 ft\n. This value needs to be\nadded\nto the indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 6 446 ft + 513 ft =\n6 959 ft\n.\nAs flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 6 959 ft, which is\nFL70\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

        "explanation": "Haze\nis traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates obscure the clarity of the sky. Haze is primarily caused by particles in the atmosphere which scatter the sunlight.\nThe increase in airborne particulates combined with specific (low) sun angles causes the slant range visibility to be reduced even further. Therefore, in this case, the pilot may expect to see the runway at a range of less than 1 500 metres.\nAn aircraft landing \"into the sun\" will experience significant haze related visibility degradation => in this case, greatest visibility deterioration will occur when landing on runway 27 (direction 270\u00ba) - into the sunset.\nWorst cases occur around sunrise during the summer months \u2013 time of day where haze-reduced visibility may be exacerbated by the low sun angle.",

The conditions needed for freezing precipitation are quite specific.\nGenerally, precipitation first falls from a cloud as snow. If it falls through warmer air before reaching the ground, it can melt and turn to rain droplets. If it then falls through cold air again before hitting the ground,\nthe droplets can become supercooled (which means that they are still falling in liquid state, even though their temperature is below 0\u00baC).\nFreezing rain/drizzle is a rare type of liquid precipitation that strikes a surface and freezes almost instantly.\nPrecipitation which contains large supercooled water droplets => Freezing Rain\nPrecipitation which contains small supercooled water droplets => Freezing Drizzle",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCOLD-AIR DROP/COLD POOL\nA cold-air drop is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it\u2019s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere.\nAs a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart\nand higher and the surface chart may show high pressure -\nThey cannot be detected on surface analysis charts.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.\nLearning Objective 050.08.03.04.03: Identify cold-air drops on weather charts.\nNote: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are\n\"cold pools\"\n, but the new syllabus refers to them as\n\"cold-air drops\"\n. They are the same so any explanations are interchangeable.",

        "explanation": "A parcel of air can hold a certain amount of water in vapour form. That amount depends on the temperature of the parcel of air. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than colder air. When a parcel of air becomes overfilled with water vapour,\nthe excess water will begin to\ncondense\ninto water droplets\n, which forms clouds, fog and dew. This most often occurs because the air parcel cools down for some reason, and therefore can no longer hold the water vapour that was already inside it, and as it cools, more and more water is released to condense into droplets.\nThe change of state from vapour is not always into droplets though. Water vapour can also change straight to ice, if the temperature is below 0\u00b0C. The water vapour actually prefers to turn straight into ice where possible due to vapour pressure differences, and this process is called deposition (gas to solid state change). It is also referred to as sublimation in America for some reason, even though Sublimation is the change of state from solid to gas, but the American interpretation is gaining more traction, so be on the lookout for people using it to describe a gas to solid state change.\nFreezing is a change of state from liquid to solid\nEvaporation is a change of state from liquid to gas.\nCondensation is from gas to liquid\nSublimation is from solid to gas (and is also from gas to solid in some countries)\nObviously at a dew point of +8\u00b0C, the water vapour is going to begin condensing into water droplets.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figures.\nThe jet stream is a fast moving \"ribbon\" of air in the upper troposphere, that occurs because of a large change in temperature between two air masses. Take the Polar jet stream, for instance. It happens because\nthe tropopause of the Ferrel Cell (Mid-Latitude, sub-tropical air) is higher than that of the Polar Cell (High Latitudes)\n,\ndue primarily to the higher temperature of the Ferrel cell\n. This means that there is a large pressure differential between the cells at the same true altitude. The Ferrel Cell air has higher pressure (at the same true altitude) than air in the Polar Cell. This pressure gradient force causes the wind to want to flow to the North. Due to the coriolis effect, this then turns right and a large collection of air joins together,\nflowing from West to East\n. When this gets above 80kt, it is called a jet stream. Jet streams can be hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, but only a few thousand feet tall.\nAll Jet streams flow from West to East\n(except the Equatorial jet, which isn't a true jet stream). In the Northern Hemisphere, that is because\nthe tropopause South of the jet stream is higher than the tropopause to the North.\nIt is important to note that the boxed numbers (\"300\", \"380\", etc.) are the indications of the pressure altitude of the tropopause in flight levels. This notation is used in high altitude charts such as sig wx charts.",

A sudden decrease is usually observed at the front. Behind the cold front, it remains steady (cold).\nPressure\n:\nbefore the front, it decreases slightly\n. At the front it starts to rise (after reaching its lowest value). A slow increase is observed behind the front.\nClouds\n: At the cold front, BKN to OVC layers may occur with CU and CB.\nHowever, if the air is stable\ncold fronts can also produce nimbostratus clouds (\nand\nstratocumulus, and stratus clouds.)\nPrecipitation\n: heavy rain or snow showers can be expected.

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThe term \u201cadiabatic process\u201d refers to the process of energy conversion in a volume of air without exchange of heat with the surroundings. We know that when a volume of a parcel of air changes the temperature changes. If the parcel of air is compressed, its temperature increases. If it is allowed to expand, its temperature decreases. This change of volume is most frequently caused by lifting the parcel of air or its subsidence. As a parcel of air is lifted to a higher level the pressure of its surrounding air decreases => the pressure inside this parcel of air is higher than its surrounding air => the parcel of air is allowed to expand => expansion results in lower temperature => parcel of air cools. This is the principle why temperature decreases with altitude. When parcel of air subsides (sinks) the opposite is true => it \"enters\" an area where the pressure of its surrounding air is higher => parcel of air is forced to compress => compression results in an increase of temperature.\nSaturation occurs when the actual water vapor content of a given parcel of air reaches the maximum value that the parcel of air can hold at the given temperature. We know that the capacity of air to hold water vapor is determined by its temperature. If the temperature is lowered to the point where the maximum water vapor holding capacity is reached or if water vapor is added and reached this \"maximum capacity\" value saturation occurs. Saturation is equivalent of 100% Relative Humidity (ratio of the actual water vapor content to the maximum possible water content capacity of the air). Cooling of the air beyond saturation point results in condensation = transformation of water vapor into liquid water - water droplets. Saturation can be achieved:\nby adding water vapor to the parcel of air and thus increasing the actual water vapor content,\nby decreasing the temperature of the air parcel (adiabatic cooling = adiabatic expansion) and thus reducing its capability to hold water vapor,\nby combination of the above.",

While thunderstorms can occur with unstable warm fronts, they are usually not produced by embedded nimbostratus clouds (Ns). Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are more likely sources of thunderstorms in such cases.\n\"In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is smaller than in the summer, and therefore the average upper winds are weaker than in the summer.\"\nIncorrect\n. In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is typically greater, which can result in stronger upper-level winds compared to the summer.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThe surface wind reduces in speed and in the Northern Hemisphere backs in direction compared with the free air gradient wind at higher altitudes. This is due to the friction forces between the air and the ground. The degree to which it changes direction and speed is a function of:\nDiurnal variation\nSurface variation\nIn the Northern Hemisphere we can create the following table for the\nsurface wind\ncompared with the free air gradient wind.\nDay:\nDirection\nSpeed\nLand\n-30\u00b0\nx 0,5\nSea\n-15\u00b0\nx 0,7\nNight:\nDirection\nSpeed\nLand\n-40\u00b0\nx 0,3\nSea\n-15\u00b0\nx 0,7\nSo, the surface wind backs in direction and lowers in speed compared to the free air gradient wind.\nIn the\nSouthern Hemisphere\n, the surface wind veers in direction compared with the free air gradient wind (opposite to NH, speed also reduces the same).\nIn case of this specific question:\nWe are in the NH near the ground and have a wind blowing from 300 at 12 knots. Looking at the above we know the surface wind backs in direction and decrease in strength. So, if we go up in altitude, we can expect the wind to veer about 30 degrees and the speed to double.

        "correct_answer": "At or near the 0\u00baC isotherm.",
        "explanation": "In this specific scenario, the aircraft is flying through a Nimbostratus cloud along a warm front. The altitude at which the temperature reaches 0\u00b0C, known as the 0\u00b0C isotherm, is located at 6 000 ft. This indicates that the temperature at that altitude is at or slightly below freezing.\nBased on these specifics, it is probable that the most severe airframe icing, caused by freezing rain, would occur\nnear or in the vicinity of the 0\u00b0C isotherm\n. This is because freezing rain has a higher likelihood of solidifying upon contact with the aircraft's surface when the temperature is freezing or slightly below. However, it is crucial to also consider the local QNH, as it can impact the altitude at which the aircraft encounters freezing rain. The local QNH, which represents atmospheric pressure, is measured at 994 hPa. Generally, a lower QNH corresponds to a lower altitude for a given flight level. Hence, if the QNH is low, the aircraft may encounter freezing rain at a lower altitude compared to a situation with a higher QNH.",

This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nCold air pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.\nWould be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher.\nThe weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.\nIf associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold air pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nCalculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level:\nThe aircraft must fly at 4 237 ft\n(2 852 + 385+ 1 000).\nThis\naltitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.\nTo compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15\u00baC. The actual temperature is \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad36\u00baC, which is an ISA deviation of\nISA +21\u00baC\nThe first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is\nISA +21\u00baC\n. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height\ncorrection for temperature\n= 4 \u00d7 (+21) \u00d7 (4 237/1 000) =\n356\nft\n.\nIn this case, the temperature correction is\nsubtracted from\nthe true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of\n\u00ad\u00ad3 881 ft\n.\nNext, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1038 hPa - 1013 hPa =\n25 hPa\n. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows:\nPressure correction\n= 25 hPa x 30 ft/hPa =\n750 ft\n. This value needs to be\nsubtracted from\nthe indicated altitude as per the rules below:\nPressure Altitude = 3881 ft - 750 ft =\n3 131 ft\n.\nAs flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 3 131 ft, which is\nFL35\n.\nRULES.\nThe following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:\nAll calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.\nThe value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.\nTo determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the \u20184 %-rule\u2019, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10\u00b0C temperature deviation from ISA.\nFor simplification:\nHeight correction for the temp = 4 \u00d7 (\nISA DEV\n) \u00d7\nIndicated alt/1000\n=\n___ ft\nIf no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.\nThe elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.\nHIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nLOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE\nWARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE\nCOLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE\nDEFINITIONS.\nPressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.\nIndicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.\nTrue altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude,\nthe thinner the air and the less performance from your engines\n(and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion,\ntemperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreased aircraft performance\n, leading to a\ndecrease in thrust and lift\n, as we climb into warmer and less dense air.\nSUMMARY: An inversion marks the boundary between layers of air having differing temperatures and to some extent density. This will result in an aircraft gaining lift, thrust and power when descending through an inversion with the reverse conditions when climbing.",

The more common definition of frontal fog is a special type of fog that only happens under a warm front, just before it passes.\nBefore a warm front passes, we are in a cold sector, so the air is cold, and therefore the ground is relatively cold as well. There is, however, warmer rain falling from above, at least towards the latter stages of the front passing. This is\nwarm rain falling through cold air\n, and tends to bring a high amount of humidity to the air it goes through.

I.e. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more.\n(b)\u00a0By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation occurs, and is unable to \"hold\" any more water.\u00a0The dew point is always lower than (or equal to) the air temperature\u00a0=> If the air temperature cools to the dew point, or if the dew point rises to equal the air temperature, then water vapour condenses and\u00a0dew, fog or clouds begin to form. At this point where the dew point temperature equals the air temperature, the relative humidity is 100%.\n\"temperature and dew point are nearly equal.\" => for condensation to occur, temperature must equal dew point.\n\"relative humidity reaches 98%.\" => condensation occurs when the air is saturated; RH = 100%.\n\"water vapour is present.\" => this is not enough for condensation to occur, the air must be saturated.",

The temperature can never be less than the dew point.\nRelative Humidity (%) = 100 - [(Temperature - Dewpoint) x 5]\nFor each degree Celsius difference between our temperature and dewpoint, there is a 5% reduction in relative humidity, starting from 100%, where the numbers are the same.

The advisability of this course would depend on the ceiling and visibility along the route at the lower level concerned.\nIn this case, the stratiform cloud is at the minimum safe altitude => therefore, a climb to a higher level should be considered.\nDo not remain in icing conditions any longer than necessary. For that reason, during climbs or descents through a layer in which icing conditions exist, plan your ascent or descent to be in the layer for as short a time as possible.\nNote: \"increase the speed\"\n. Speed of an airplane affects accretion of ice. The faster an airplane moves through an area of supercooled water drops, the more moisture it encounters and the faster will be the accumulation of ice.",

It can be caused by\nvertical movement of air \"pockets\"\n, through either\nconvective\nor mechanical means, or can be caused by a sudden change in horizontal wind speed, called windshear.\nClouds can be a good indication of the air patterns present, as stratiform clouds show stable, non-turbulent air, and\ncumuliform clouds show the presence of unstable, turbulent air.\nCumulus clouds are formed when air rises, and by doing so, becomes warmer than its environment, due to a high ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate, the air wants to continue to rise. Rising air cools down, and therefore becomes closer to the dewpoint (the relative humidity rises) until the dewpoint is reached, and the air becomes saturated, forming a cloud.\nTherefore,\nthe air just below a cumulus cloud is rising at quite a rate\n, but\nnot perfectly evenly\n, due to unstable heating, meaning that there is\na large difference in updraft speed from one pocket of air to the next, which causes lots of turbulence\n. The base of a cumulus cloud often has more turbulence than the rest of the cloud, on average.\nDowndrafts can also occur in cumulus clouds, and this would cause even greater turbulence, when happening next to an updraft.",

        "correct_answer": "An inflow of cold air over land or strong radiation cooling in the evening can lead to an inversion; at or just below the top of the inversion a low-level jet stream can form.",
        "explanation": "The low level jet stream is a term used for a wind at around 5000 ft above the surface, which forms due to either\nintense, uneven surface cooling at night\n, or the\nmovement of a cold mass of air over the ground\n. The movement of this cold mass of air pushes under the warmer air and\ncreates an inversion\nthat looks exactly like a small cold front. The\nmarked temperature difference\nbetween the warm and cold air causes a pressure differential, which causes a wind\nup to around 70 kts\nin the warm air section, which sits over the cold air that is moving in.\nThese are common in the central United States and the plains of Southern Germany, amongst other places, and are not technically a jet stream according to the World Meteorological Organisation's definition. They occur in a similar fashion to a jet stream, though, hence the name.\nNote: Technically,\nthe low-level nocturnal jetstream exists above the inversion\n, however, the answer (from feedback) may still be somewhat correct, as the question does not make it clear what is meant by the \"top of the inversion\". As we would usually see this from a side-on view, we know that the low-level jetstream exists in the warm air (in front of the cold front), with its \"core\" high up away from the surface, and near the top of where the cold front extends up to. This would usually mean being above the inversion when referenced to a single location, but is a little unclear in this question\nThis may be what the examiner is referring to,\nso if anyone has exam feedback about the wording of the correct answer, it would be very useful to verify this question.

The lower levels of the stratosphere would therefore be around the region of 36 000 ft to 50 000 ft.\nLet's go through each option individually:\nA)\n\"Horizontal movement of air masses is much less than in the troposphere, therefore very little head- or tailwind is to be expected.\"\nThe wind in the lower stratosphere is\nstill plenty strong enough to cause significant head- or tailwinds\n. The jetstreams sometimes extend upwards above the tropopause, and therefore this answer is wrong.\nB)\n\"The air in the lower stratosphere is very dry. Therefore, there are very few clouds in the stratosphere.\"\nIndeed, the air is very dry in the stratosphere, especially as it is so cold, so cannot hold much water vapour at all. This, and the stability of the isothermal layer, make clouds very rare in the stratosphere.\nCorrect.\nC)\n\"There is strong vertical movement of air masses and therefore more turbulence to be expected in the lower stratosphere than would be felt in the troposphere.\"\nThe stratosphere is isothermal, and is therefore stable. Rising air therefore stops at the tropopause, and there is very little vertical movement of air above this point (in comparison to the troposphere.

However, in this situation, because of the temperature inversion, the temperature decreases as altitude reduces. Falling through cold air (between 5000 ft and 2000 ft), the droplets become supercooled.\nFreezing rain consists of raindrops that have become supercooled after falling from warmer air into air where the temperature is below zero => which happens between 5000 ft (+7\u00baC) and 2000 ft (-4\u00baC)\n.

Please send us any further exam feedback in the comments, on the question feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you!\nA small-scale intense low pressure zone on route would be likely to bring very unsettled weather in that region. The inflow of air near the surface leads to air rising in the core of the low pressure region, and this brings large convective cloud formations, particularly in summer. This would be very likely to cause CBs and thunderstorms. Of course, these would be associated with\nheavy rainfall and turbulence\n, as well as icing, wind shear, hail, lightning, etc.\nAs for visibility, low pressure zones like this tend to have good visibility outside of the clouds/precipitation as the mixing of air makes sure the particles causing bad visbility do not sit in a haze (as happens with high pressure). However, there is no option that says this, so for now we have to just assume they are talking about the\nvery poor visibility in the clouds and precipitation\n(until we get any feedback that changes or verifies the options).",

If future feedback shows they are the same question completely, they will be merged.\nThis question is really tricky because of its options.\nThe correct answer is the South-West Monsoon\nto our knowledge, as this is the standard name for that monsoon in the syllabus, however,\nthat is the monsoon that occurs during Summer\n. Therefore, it is just a case of knowing the correct name of it in the syllabus. This is made even worse by the fact they mention the South-Easterly trade winds, which could confuse you further.\nWe could use some extra feedback to confirm the wording on this question also, thank you.\nSo for starters, by the question saying that the South-Easterly trade winds are blowing over India, it means that\nthe ITCZ has travelled to the North of India\n, and therefore it is Northern Hemisphere Summer. The trade-winds actually stop blowing from the SE when they cross over to the Northern Hemisphere, and the Coriolis force (still quite weak near the Equator) begins to turn them to the right instead, so they actually arrive at India from the South-West.

If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter\u2019s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above sea level.\nQFE\n. The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level).\nIn the case of this specific question:\nThe question states that the QNH is 1025 hPa, and that Locarno is 200 metres above sea level. They ask us to calculate the QFE.\nLet's start by converting 200 m into ft.\n(1 metre is 3.28 feet)\n3.28 x 200 = 656 feet\nWe now want to know how many hPa correspond to 656 feet, therefore we divide it by 27 (27 is the amount of feet per 1 hPa close to the ground) = 24.3 hPa\nQFE = 1025 hPa - 24.3 hPa =\n1000 hPa approx.\nNote: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.

Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black\n- Visible satellite image show solid clouds (such as CBs) as bright white and wispy clouds (thin or faint cloud - such as cirrus) as translucent whitish layers.\nInfrared (IR).\nInfrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image =>\nIf the clouds near the surface are approx. same temperature as the land surface it can be difficult to distinguish the clouds from land.\nTo get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images.\nIf both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area.\nIf you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud\nIf you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThis situation is quite complex to forecast, but there are some absolutes that we know. High pressure zones such as this anticyclone will give\nclear weather\ndue to the subsidence of air\n, which will mean dry days and very cold nights during the winter (20th February). The ground will therefore be very cold after a few days of this.\nWater\nis not as affected by this, as it holds its heat much better, so\nwill be warmer than the land\n.\nThis cold land does make fog very likely in the mornings, namely radiation fog, which occurs when the land cools the lower layers of air until they reach their dewpoint, however,\nthe question is not asking about the morning\n, instead about the afternoon and evening. This would no longer be affected by radiation fog, which will have been removed over most of the country by this point in the day due to solar insolation (there is not much solar insolation, during winter, but enough to remove the fog).\nThere will still be some other fog, though, at the coasts where the wind is blowing from the sea. This is advection fog.\nAdvection fog forms when warm, humid air, flows over a cold surfac\ne; in this case,\nthe warmer, more humid sea air blowing over the colder land\n. The\nlow level air then quickly cools to its dewpoint and forms fog.\nThe wind is likely to be quite light at this point, but will\nlikely be more than 5 kts from the Irish sea towards the coast of Wales (red arrows in annex above)\n, which is\njust enough to form advection fog\n. Furthermore, we can see a cold front moving southwards nearby, so there must be some wind in that area.\nThe other options require a lot of cloud, which would not occur in a high pressure zone like this (where air subsides), and the option stating \"radiation fog\" is a morning phenomenon, not one that would happen in the afternoon/evening, as explained above.\nNote:\nThis question does require a little bit of geography knowledge, such as the location of Ireland and Wales. Similar knowledge of European geography is required in many questions, so is a good thing to learn, if not already known.

        "explanation": "A pilot must make sure that the airframe is clear of icing before departure, and this is a common problem during winter operations. Airframe icing on the ground is similar to in-flight icing, in that the water droplets need some reason to freeze onto the airframe. For starters,\nwater needs to be present\n(visible moisture is another term for this), and there needs to be a component that is\nbelow 0\u00baC, whether that be the air, the airframe itself (often the case on a winter's morning), or the water droplets\n(SCWDs - Super-cooled water droplets, water that exists in a liquid form below 0\u00baC). The worst icing occurs when the airframe is cold and water or rain droplets freeze directly onto it,\ncreating hard lumps on the wing that destroy the wing's airflow on take-off\n.\nThere are other types of icing that can happen to an aircraft on the ground. In fact, hoar frost can be quite common, particularly if an airframe is very cold and the air contains a high relative humidity, allowing the water vapour to turn straight into ice crystals on the airframe by deposition (the opposite of sublimation). Even considering this, there is still only one good answer here.",

The change in weather appears to be mostly a\nreduction in pressure\n, from approximately\n1000 hPa or 1001 hPa from the isobars on the chart, to 995 hPa\nin the later METAR.

This stable air condition often leads to the formation of\nstratiform clouds\n(St and Sc) with cloud bases lower than the hilltops. This type of cloud formation can create hazardous conditions similar to fog.\nCold air mass: When the air is colder than the surface below, it experiences heating from below, resulting in an unstable air mass. In this scenario, the unstable air can cause the development of patchy cumulus clouds with significant variations in visibility.",

That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but\ntheir true altitude will gradually decrease.\nThe nice thing about this question is that we\ndo not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for\n. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with\na strong crosswind from the left, the aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing\n(unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations).\nTo go through the options:\n\"The aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing.\"\nCorrect, as explained above.\n\"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\"\nThe aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190).\n\"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\"\nRadio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work.\n\"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\"\nThe pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed.\nThere are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW.\nNE MONSOON:\nIn winter \u2013 December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high \u2013 bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand.\nIt also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges).\nNW MONSOON:\nWhen crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea.\nSW MONSOON:\nIn Summer \u2013 June, July and August\n, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW \u2013 giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon).

When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour,\nmoisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain\u2019s upwind slopes.\nAs the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope \u2013 because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.\nOn the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation\nwhilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.\nThe greatest risk of aircraft icing is found on the windward side\nof the mountain in saturated air and thick clouds, such as cumuliform clouds.\nNote: In this case, with wind coming from the west, the western side will be the windward side.\nHalfway up the slope, the air may not be saturated yet and condensation may not have started yet => risk of icing is, therefore, lower. At the height of the ridge is the most correct option since we don't know the saturation of the air before the ridge.",

When high pressure forms in the Bay of Biscay, and low pressure in the Gulf of Genoa, the wind lines up roughly with the valleys of Southern France, which will\nchannel the air\n, and use\nthe Venturi effect\n(amongst other effects) to increase the wind speed, and change the direction of the air to flow along the valley, towards the Mediterranean Sea. It is usually a cold wind, and usually occurs in dry weather, giving clear skies and of course, strong winds.\nNote: This question simply wants us to know that the Mistral is a valley wind. The current feedback says that the correct answer is,\n\"Strong surface winds blowing across a river valley.\"\n. We believe that \"along\" a river valley would be more correct, but given the other options, this is still by far the most correct answer.

Ice crystals previously were thought to be harmless to airplanes because\nthey will not adhere to the external airframe\n, and will simply bounce off the airframe without accreting.\nNowadays, researchers believe that ice crystals can partially melt, due to compression effects, as they pass through the engine fan section, enter the engine core and create a film of moisture on relatively warm surfaces, such as the forward stator vanes.\nThe moisture traps additional ice crystals, and, eventually, the ice buildup is shed into the compressor, causing the engine to surge and stall and possibly the combustor, causing a flameout.\nAnother possible cue to the presence of a high concentration of ice crystals at altitude is anomalous total air temperature (TAT) indications, which include the increase in outside static air temperature due to compression.\nResearchers believe that erratic and erraneously warm TAT indications are caused by ice crystals that build up on heated TAT probes and block the airflow through the probes.",

This, in turn, may influence the pressure altimeter reading.\nWhen air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline,\nthe velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases\n. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop.\nA decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude. As altitude is calculated, when compared to the reference pressure setting (i.e QNH), when flying into lower pressure, the true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude. Consequently,\nif the pilot maintains a constant indicated altitude, the true altitude will decrease. This is depicted in\nfigure 4\n.",

        "explanation": "Refer to figure.\nThis question is a little tricky as it is asking about\nthe effect of the\nwarm front\n,\nnot the foehn effect\n.\nThe warm front means that the air in front of the warm front is colder than the air that comes after the warm front. The warmer air behind rides up over the cooler air in front, creating the slanted front. This slant means that the cloud base drops as the front gets closer to a position. With a few hundred miles to go before the front passes overhead, you can expect high level cirrus clouds, followed by lowering clouds of cirrostratus, altostratus, nimbostratus (rain clouds), and finally low level stratus with some fog and stratus fractus.\nIn relation to this question then, the front is travelling from West to East, so the front is passing over the western faces of the mountains, which will have a very low cloud base and rain/fog.\nThe Eastern faces\n, however,\nhave yet to be passed over\n, so will have a\nhigher cloud base than 2 000 ft\n, and are in the\ncold sector\n, so the\ntemperature will be lower there also.\nThere are a few questions that exist similar to this, but without the presence of the warm front. This makes them affected more so by the foehn effect, which is where the windward side of the mountains gets rained on, reducing the moisture in the air, so the air is drier and warmer on the lee-side.\nThe passing of a warm front is a much larger event\n, and is therefore enough to negate any such temperature change due to the foehn effect.",

        "explanation": "In the standard troposphere air temperature on average decreases with height at an overall positive lapse rate of about 2\u00baC/1000 ft, until the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, is reached.\nIf the temperature at FL80 is +6\u00baC, we know that at FL130 it will be 10\u00baC colder => ((13 000 - 8 000)/1000) x 2 = 10\u00baC\nAs discussed above, in the troposphere under normal circumstances, temperature decreases with increasing altitude =>\ntemperature at FL130 = +6\u00baC - 10\u00baC = -4\u00baC",
